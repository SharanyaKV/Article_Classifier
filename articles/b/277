    Bharti Airtel  has sought permission from telecom regulator  Trai  to offer video content through a private network, but exclusively to its customers. The company fears that the service may be in "violation of principles of net neutrality".  The move is being seen as an attempt by India's biggest telecom company to gauge the regulator's stand on the contentious issue of offering content through a private network or intranet.  In a letter written to the Trai secretary on April 25,  Airtel  asked whether the offer of video content through closed electronic communications network (CECN) -which had been left out in the regulator's February order banning discriminatory tariffs on the internet -would be permitted. The company sa id it had been approached by "one of the big global content providers who wishes to offer their video content on exclusive basis over CECN of Airtel".  ?"We submit that while such an arrangement with the global content provider over CECN along with its exclusive offerings to our customers would be compliant to regulations, it may well be viewed by some stakeholders in violation of principles of net neutrality," Airtel's chief regulatory officer said in the letter. "Prior to arriving at any business decision on such an arrangement, we request the authority (Trai) to advise us if we can go ahead with it," Airtel added.    There is a widespread speculation that a few players in the telecom industry are preparing arich library of video and other content, which will be available only to their subscribers.      Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm is about to launch its services and may offer a huge library of content at a very low price to attract customers.      Reliance Jio did not respond to questions on whether the move by Airtel could be an attempt to pre-empt the launch of its content services, possibly through private network. Airtel's move may also be prompted by the company's past decisions, which were criticised for violating  net neutrality  . Last year, the company's decision to launch a zero-rated platform -Airtel Zero -attracted heavy criticism.It also faced flak when it increased the data price for calls made through apps.      While Trai's order against differential tariffs over the internet was appreciated by net neutrality activists, its decision to make an exception for CECN creates scope for content distribution over private networks.Trai has made it clear that its order is applicable only for the content on the internet, and not intranet or closed networks.
