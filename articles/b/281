Last year a record 1.2million drivers attended a speed awareness course, up from 447,700 five years ago, according to the National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme. 

However, many subsequently risk invalidating their motor cover by failing to disclose attendance to their car insurer. 

Most police forces offer motorists who commit a minor speeding offence the option of attending a course, rather than accepting three penalty points and a minimum £100 fine. 

Matt Oliver, spokesman for car insurance at GoCompare.com, said the four-hour courses also cost around £100, but the police do not record your speeding offence as a conviction. 

An SP30 speeding conviction can add around £32.34 a year to an annual insurance premium for a 30-year-old driver, rising to around £377 for a 20-year-old, Oliver explained. 

If your insurer asks if you have any motoring convictions, you can legitimately answer “no” if you have only attended a course. 

However, if it asks specifically about course attendance, you must provide this information or risk invalidating your insurance. 

Some insurers may charge slightly more, but this is likely to cost less than if you have points on your licence. 

Oliver added: “It is also easier to shop around for cheaper cover elsewhere.”
