Expedia plans to hire hands in India

Global online travel agency Expedia plans to hire 200 employees by the end of this year in India. The country is among its top three markets in terms of size and growth in Asia, says Expedia.

“We are very bullish on India and have extensive growth plans. In a little over four years, we have grown to over 800 employees and are poised to reach the 1000-employee mark across Gurgaon, Mumbai and Bangalore by the end of this year,” Jonathon Sinclair Neal, Chief Executive Officer at AirAsia Expedia (AAE) Travel told

Mr. Neal recently took charge as the CEO of the joint venture between Expedia and AirAsia, in which NASDAQ-listed Expedia holds majority 75 per cent stake.

Talking about the travel market in the country, Mr. Neal said the Indian travel market has a lot going for it.

“Steady macro-economic conditions and the recently-announced tourism centric initiatives by the government such as expanding electronic visa to 150 countries, have brought optimism back to the industry.
