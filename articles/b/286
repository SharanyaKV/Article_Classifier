PETALING JAYA:
 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) president and group executive director Arul Kanda Kandasamy yesterday stated that it had dealt with senior executives in the payment of some US$3.5 billion (RM13.7 billion) deposits to Aabar Investments PJS (Aabar BVI), transactions which bind International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) and Aabar BVI as corporates.

IPIC has denied links to Aabar BVI, stating that it is common knowledge that the company is defunct.

“What is more important, in my view, is 1MDB’s firm contention on the US$3.5 billion deposits paid to Aabar BVI. 1MDB maintains that it dealt with senior executives, hence these transactions bind IPIC and Aabar PJS as corporates – bluntly put, it is an internal matter for them to resolve,” he said in a statement yesterday.  

Arul Kanda added that 1MDB will not shy away, and looks forward to resolving its dispute with IPIC through discussion and if necessary, arbitration, in order to ensure an expeditious resolution.
