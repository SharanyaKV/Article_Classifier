  Amit Acharya bought his first policy in 2000, when he was 29, and added four more plans as his income grew in the following years. Now 45, he regrets the investments made on his father's advice. "The life insurance plans he recommended will give barely 6% returns," says the Raipur-based MNC manager.  In Delhi, 43-year-old Ashok Vishwakarma is ruing his decision to join SpeakAsia. He poured Rs 33,000 into the scam. "Had I not been greedy and put the money in a fixed deposit, it would have grown to over Rs 50,000 by now," he says.  Many people make such investing mistakes in their youth, only to regret the decisions in later years. You can't turn the clock back, so it's better to avoid these mistakes now. Here are eight such money moves you might regret 15-20 years from now.   Delay investing till income is higher   For young earners, spending is more important than saving. A study of 2,000 professionals by Hyderabad-based financial planning firm, Arthayantra, found that more than 90% don't start planning for retirement in the first five years of their careers. Even by the 10th year, less than 20% would have a retirement plan in place. The consequences of this delay are mind boggling. If an investor starts an SIP of Rs 5,000 in an equity fund that gives 12% returns, he will accumulate Rs 1.77 crore in 30 years. But if he waits till 28 to start investing, his corpus will be smaller by Rs 56 lakh. What he puts away in the first 10 years will account for almost 72% of the total corpus. The longer the delay, the smaller is the corpus.   Taking too little risk with investments   Though there is irrefutable empirical evidence that equities can give high returns in the long term, small investors continue to rely heavily on fixed income investments. Equities account for a very small proportion of the total household savings. Surprisingly, even young investors who are in a position to invest in stocks, opt for the safety of bank deposits and small savings schemes. This aversion for equities could prove harmful in the long term. If you spend Rs 40,000 a month on household expenses today , even 6% inflation will push that up to Rs 72,000 a month by 2026. By 2031, the requirement will surge to Rs 96,000 and by 2036, it would be Rs 1.28 lakh a month. This is why even risk averse investors should consider allocating at least 10-15% of their portfolios to equities.   Not following an asset allocation   Not many investors believe in rebalancing. Less than 10% respondents to an online survey said they rebalanced their portfolios regularly. Yet, it is the mantra that ensures high returns at low risk. We back-calculated and found that if an investor had put 60% in stocks, 30% in fixed income and 10% in gold in 2006 and not touched the investment, his portfolio would have earned overall returns of 10.1%. However, if he had rebalanced the portfolio every year in January, his returns would have been higher at 12%. Rebalancing is not easy because it takes a contrarian call. Few investors would have reduced their equity expo sure when the markets were making new highs between 2004 and 2007. If they had, their portfolios would not have bled so much in 2008. If you rebalance regularly, you will not have any regrets.   Getting lured by dubious schemes   SpeakAsia and Stock Guru are just two examples of how investors can be lured by greed and easy money. The fantastic returns promised by the fraudster should have been a red flag for investors. It is virtually impossible to churn out 10-20% returns every month. The other basic check is to see whether the scheme is approved by the regulator. All investment schemes must have Sebi approval. Stock Guru had nothing to show in this regard. Fraudsters try to mislead investors by uploading images of PAN cards and certificate of incorporation. But these documents don't mean that the scheme has been approved by Sebi.   Dipping into PF account   The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) is God's gift to investors. If you are diligent, it can make you a crorepati. A person with a basic salary of Rs 25,000 a month at the age of 25 can accumulate Rs 1.65 crore in the EPF over a period of 35 years. This assumes that his income will rise by 10% every year and the EPF will earn 8.7% returns. Yet, many people are unable to reach the Rs 1 crore milestone in their EPF accounts. Every time they change jobs, they withdraw their EPF balance. Withdrawing your EPF is financial hara-kiri. The money goes into unnecessary expenses and the retirement corpus is back to zero. It's a decision you will regret when you are close to retirement.   Treating insurance as investment   The cardinal rule is not to mix insurance with investment. Yet, millions of traditional insurance policies that give the "triple benefits" of life insurance, long-term savings and tax benefits are bought every year. These policies not only give sub-optimal returns of 5-6%, but also force the policyholder into a multi-year commitment. Is there a way out? Yes, you can surrender a policy if you have paid premiums for a minimum number of years. Be ready to suffer a loss when you do this.  You can also convert an insurance policy into a paid-up plan after three years. The policy will continue with a reduced sum assured but you won't have to pay the premiums any further. It is better than paying premiums for the full term and earning 5-6% returns.     Splurging on items you don't need       As mentioned earlier, young people spend more than they save. But in many cases, they even spend more than they earn. Easy financing options and plastic money prevent young individuals from distinguishing their wants from their needs. They may need to save for retirement, but the new cell phone they want has come in the way. If this urge to spend gets out of hand, it can prove catastrophic. Rein in your spending now if you don't want to regret later. Many young people don't save because there is nothing left after all their expenses. Their equation is: Income Expenses = Savings. Legendary investor Warren Buffett offers a simple solution. Change the equation to Income Savings = Expenses. Instead of saving what is left after expenses, spend what is left after savings.       Not setting up an emergency fund       Everyone needs an emergency fund. You could lose your job, or somebody in the family may need medical care - you never know what lies ahead. It is often argued that you don't need emergency cash if you have a credit card. A credit card does come in handy when you face a financial crisis but the cushion that plastic money provides lasts only 15-30 days, till the bill arrives. If you don't have an emergency fund, you could be forced to liquidate other assets to tide over the crisis.
