Amazon tops list of highest paying tech firms for millennial recruits

As well as a forecast-beating first quarter performance, Amazon's young employees have been given another reason to cheer - they are the best paid among their peers in the tech sector, according to new data.

Amazon on average pays a £75,000 salary and a £15,000 bonus to recruit millenials into entry level positions, an analysis from salary benchmarking site Emolument.com shows.

Apple comes in second offering those who turn their backs on City jobs and more traditional careers a £72,000 salary with a potential £11,000 bonus, while at third-place Google, entry level staff typically get £59,000 and a possible £14,000 on top.

Emolument's Alice Leguay said pay in tech is fasting catching up with that in the financial world.

"While bonuses in technology remain smaller than in banking, the diminishing pay differential added to the on-trend corporate culture and a flexible working environment with better work-life balance and many perks make up an irresistible package for Generation Y."

As workers climb the ladder, it's Microsoft that tops the pay league table, doling out an average pay packet worth £101,000 to senior employees. Apple and Google remain in second and third place, offering a total of £97,000 and £92,000, respectively.
