EPF: No problem with our 1MDB bond


KUALA LUMPUR:
 The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has reiterated that it is not concerned over its bond subscription in 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) despite the latter having triggered cross-defaults for its bonds.

"EPF's exposure to 1MDB is very limited, we have RM200 million of the first RM5 billion issuance. That exposure is fully government guaranteed, we don't have a problem with it.

"In the event of major problem with 1MDB, the government will step in to cover the debts with all bond holders," EPF CEO Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan told a press conference here today.

Last week, 1MDB said it had defaulted on the US$1.75 billion 1MDB Energy (Langat) bond following a dispute with Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), triggering cross-defaults for RM7.4 billion in other bonds.
