The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused liquor baron Vijay Mallya's plea to keep his overseas assets confidential. 


The court ordered his assets to be revealed to banks for recovery of debts. 


"We will even approach the UK government, if required, for recovery of loans through liquidation of Vijay Mallya's overseas assets," banks tell the apex court. 


"Mallya is a fugitive fleeing from justice. If he really wants to come, a one-way travel permit could have been arranged," said the Attorney General. 


Mr. Mallya said, "Asking for my overseas assets is a violation of my privacy."
