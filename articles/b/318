Su-Kam Power Systems on Tuesday announced the introduction of a solar street light that also incorporates a lithium ion battery, which means that the street light does not need to be connected to the grid, and can also function during power outages.

“Sunway, compared to grid street lights, eliminates the need for expensive cabling, and keeps providing light even during a blackout while giving a zero power bill,” the company said in a release.

 “The solar street light industry has been suffering due to the inefficient lead acid technology-based street light solutions.

The government had in January 2015 launched a Street Light National Programme, which envisaged the replacement of 3.5 crore conventional street lights, which was estimated to save nine billion units of electricity a year. The government has replaced 750,780 street lights as of Tuesday, which would save around 99 million units of electricity, according to the programme website.

The new street lights, which Su-Kam said are manufactured in India, will come in six models ranging from 4W to 50W.

“I think all the street lights in India should be solar-powered,” Kunwer Sachdev, Managing Director, Su-Kam said at the launch. “India is blessed with good weather and abundant sunshine. But we realised that traditional solar street lights were inefficient, required high maintenance and were prone to battery thefts.”
