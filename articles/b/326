Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava has called the ban on registration of diesel cars over 2000 cc in the national capital region ‘arbitrary’.

“Our view is that this ban is totally arbitrary. While new BS IV cars are banned, nothing has been done about the pre BS-I cars, which are even more polluting,” he said.

“There are 5.7 million two-wheelers, they cause three times more pollution than cars. Trucks cause 4.5 times more pollution than cars, but nobody talks about them,” he pointed out. 

In Delhi, there are about 6 lakh diesel cars, one-third of which are not even BS-I compliant. Mr. Bhargava also said that the auto industry was not in favour of an environment cess which has been considered by the apex court. “As part of the automobile industry, we feel that such a cess has already been imposed by the government in the Budget,” he said.

Separately, Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises G M Siddeshwara told Parliament that “it is too soon to understand the impact of the said ban on investment in the country.”
