PETALING JAYA: 
The prime minister’s press secretary, Datuk Seri Tengku Sariffudin Tengku Ahmad, has called out The Wall Street Journal  (WSJ) for naming Tan Sri Irwan Serigar as the likely candidate for the Bank Negara Malaysia governor’s post before an official announcement on the matter was made.

The government yesterday announced the appointment of current deputy governor Datuk Muhammad Ibrahim as the next central bank governor, succeeding Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz.

Sariffudin said WSJ published the report despite no announcement being made and was based on anonymous sources.

He added that WSJ had made itself a willing vehicle of political opponents just for the sake of sensational headlines.
