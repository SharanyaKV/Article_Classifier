Around 1,000 jobs at the 120-year-old brand are thought to be at risk, with confirmation of the firm's collapse expected imminently, according to Sky News.

Austin Reed is currently trading as normal and is reportedly still accepting customer gift vouchers across its 155 stores.

Customers of the renowned firm have included Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Taylor.

But the chain has struggled in recent years and last year closed down 31 unprofitable stores.

Insolvency experts AlixPartners has been trying to find a buyer for the firm, but has not been able to make a deal.

The demise of another high street stalwart has heightened concerns for the UK economy and the future of other brands.

Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex.com, said: "With Next and M&amp;S having difficult quarters, and BHS likely to have disappeared off the high street by the end of the year, it is a tough time to be in the UK retail sector. 

"As a whole retail sales have been rather limp since 2016 began, dipping into negative territory year-on-year for 4 of the past 6 months.

"Whether this means any more companies will follow BHS’ lead, or whether the that store’s collapse is an isolated incident, is unclear; what is clear, however, is that a combination of financial reticence on behalf of the customer and the struggle to compete with online giants like Amazon has left the high street in a rather sorry state."

Retail footfall figures fell by 2.7 per cent in March compared to a year ago, with shopping centres witnessing declines of 3.7 per cent, according to Springboard’s UK retail footfall figures.
