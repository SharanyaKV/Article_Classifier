 ICICI Bank on Friday reported its worst numbers in over a decade with consolidated net profit plunging 87 per cent in the March quarter to Rs. 406.71 crore due to a spike in provisioning for bad loans.

 Higher provisioning is in view of Reserve Bank’s asset quality review (AQR) as well as expectations of further bad loan issues at the country’s largest private sector lender.

 The Chanda Kochhar-led bank had posted a post-tax net of Rs. 3,084 crore on a consolidated basis in January-March quarter of last fiscal and Rs. 3,122 crore in the preceding quarter, when it started recognising the effects of bad loans following the AQR.

 On a standalone basis, the bank’s net profit tanked 76 per cent to Rs. 701.89 crore from Rs. 2,922 crore a year ago.

 In the broader market, the Sensex fell by 169.65 points at 25,436.97.
