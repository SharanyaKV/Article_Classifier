Agent Provocateur names LVMH veteran Fabrizio Malverdi as new chief

Fans of Agent Provocateur could soon see some Italian influence in its lingerie after LVMH stalwart Fabrizio Malverdi was picked as its new chief executive.

The fashion veteran will move to London from Paris, where he has done stints in the past decade at Dior Homme, John Galliano and Givenchy.

Chairman Chris Woodhouse said Malverdi, who earlier worked for Agent Provocateur co-founder Joe Corré’s mother Dame Vivienne Westwood, was “renowned for his focus on creative product, growth and value creation”.

When Agent Provocateur parted ways with former boss Garry Hogarth earlier this year, it was seen as a sign that private equity owner 3i was moving closer to a sale of the 22-year-old company.

Woodhouse had suggested a new leader would prepare the firm for a sale but a deal would not happen this year.

The company, which paid Hogarth £250,000, did not reveal details of Malverdi’s pay.
