EPF sees better contribution from local market in 2016


KUALA LUMPUR:
 The Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which posted a 13.2% growth in investment income last year, expects the domestic market to perform better this year in view of the volatile external environment.

For 2015, foreign investments contributed 48% of the total RM44.23 billion gross investment income though they only made up 25% of total assets.

However, EPF CEO Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan foresees a reversal this year, with domestic investments seen to make better income contribution in 2016.

"This year, we expect a pick up in domestic market performance, that will make up some of the short fall in the global market," he told reporters at the launch of EPF Annual Report 2015.

Acknowledging that it will still be a challenging market this year, Shahril said EPF would strive to achieve its dividend target of inflation rate plus 2%.
