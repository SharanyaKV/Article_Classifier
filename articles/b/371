Asda has agreed to scrap “misleading” price promotions after the supermarket chain was singled out in a competition watchdog investigation.

The Competition and Markets Authority said it was concerned about “was/now” deals — when a discounted price is compared with a previous higher one — as well as some multi-buy offers.

The watchdog said it “has had particular engagement with Asda” and the company had “given a commitment to the CMA” that it will change the way it runs promotions. 

The investigation follows a complaint from consumer group Which? in April last year that claimed retailers were creating the illusion of savings through an array of baffling offers.

Deals which the CMA found to be particularly misleading included “was/now” promotions when the goods had been on sale longer at the “now” price than at the original “was” price. 

Asda has also promised not to follow multi-buy offers immediately with “was/now” promotions so it will be easier for shoppers to tell what is a good offer.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: “Asda has been found breaking the rules and now must immediately clean up its act.”

Asda chief executive Andy Clarke said: “Asda has won the Grocer 33, the most credible pricing measure in our industry, for the last 18 years and we’re pleased that the CMA has today recognised that we take pricing compliance seriously.” @JonPrynn
