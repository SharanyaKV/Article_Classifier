SBI cuts home loan rates


State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, has reduced its home loan rate by 5 basis points to 9.40 per cent. The revision in the rate follows reduction in the one year marginal cost of fund rate to 9.15 per cent from 9.20 per cent.



The new rate came into effect from May 1.



Banks have shifted to a new loan pricing regime from April 1, namely marginal cost of based Lending rate (MCLR) as mandated by Reserve Bank of India. The move was aimed at making transmission of monetary policy more effective.
