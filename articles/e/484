Hollyoaks spoilers: Ste DIES in killer lake showdown with Cameron?


The net is closing in on killer Cameron in next week’s Hollyoaks – and we all know how he reacts when he is under pressure!


As Ste remains suspicious over Lockie’s whereabouts, a thoughtful Leela asks Cameron to call his brother – but how will he react to her request? Meanwhile, a shocked Harry uncovers an engraving on the floor of the shack which says ‘Cameron is a killer’.

After being shown the engraving, Ste swipes Cameron’s phone and demands to know why there is no record of any calls to Lockie. When John Paul later fills Ste in on the night Cameron offered a lift to Lockie, Ste feels he has enough evidence that Cameron has killed Lockie and heads to the police station.

After Ste’s report, Ben quizzes Cameron over Lockie’s whereabouts – but how will he respond?

Later, Cameron heads out to the lake to scatter his dad’s ashes but Ste heads along with him and the pair are soon discussing Lockie while on the boat. Ste’s suspicions skyrocket once more when Cameron talks about Lockie in the past tense as if he is no longer alive and before long, the two men are desperately fighting.

As a desperate Cameron lashes out, Ste falls into the water and struggles to keep his head above the surface.

As he sinks into the depths, Cameron has a big decision – will he let Ste drown or will he have a last minute attack of conscience and save his life?
