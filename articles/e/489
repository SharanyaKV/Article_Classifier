Mads Mikkelsen says Hannibal COULD return for a 4th season despite being dropped from NBC

He is the man responsible for bringing Hannibal Lecter to life on the small screen – and now Mads Mikkelsen says that the show could make a return after it was unexpectedly axed last year after just three seasons.

The Doctor Strange actor has refused to play down the possibility of the show returning on another network – after NBC dropped it – and said that show runner Bryan Fuller would be responsible for determining whether Mr Lecter gets another taste of human flesh.

‘It all depends on Bryan. He is the key, the base, the heart’, Mikkelsen told 
the Daily Express
.

‘We will wait and see what happens next in his career. But we all know that we can easily pick this up in two or three years, there are breaks in the stories. We could pick it up, say, four years later. If Bryan is up for it, we will all go for it?’

He also spoke of his anger at the show’s initial cancellation, and described it as ‘madness.’

He said: ‘We are all angry. We were p****d. It’s madness. And season four was actually the one we thought we’d definitely get. Seasons two and three were on the verge. We didn’t know whether Hannibal would be renewed.

‘But by the time we got to season four we thought it was a definite. We were very surprised at the decision.’

Until that renewal does or doesn’t come, we’ll have to make do with a nice Chianti.
