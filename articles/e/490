  Kannada actress Sindhu Loknath is known for her girl-next-door image, but she seems to be working extra hard at getting rid of the tag. While her last film, Love in Manya, opposite Ninasam Sathish, had her portray a glimpse of her glam avataar in the song Currentu Hoda Timealli, her next film, Jai Bajarangabali, opposite Ajai Rao, has her attempting yet another glam avataar.         The song, Hrudayada Battery, is sent against a futuristic backdrop and Sindhu, and Ajai are seen in the modern best.           Watch the song Hrudayada Battery, from Jai Bajarangabali here.
