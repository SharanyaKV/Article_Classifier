Gaz Beadle slams claims he cheated on Charlotte Crosby with Ex On The Beach threesome – because she’s not his girlfriend


Geordie Shore’s Gaz Beadle has slammed claims 
he cheated on Charlotte Crosby with two women on Ex On The Beach
.


So what’s his argument? Amazingly, he claims he and Charlotte aren’t even boyfriend and girlfriend. News to us, for sure.

In a series of angry tweet replies, he took issue with the idea that Charlotte would be upset by any of his sexual antics despite the fact 
all evidence suggests they’ve been dating for a while now
.

Responding to an article about the controversy, he wrote: ‘You f***ing kidding!! “Boyfriend” since when were we boyfriend and girlfriend?’

 
👫👊🏼

He added: ‘Exactly we weren’t!! So how can you say I cheated!?!?!?’, then wrote: ‘And relax…. Rant over….’

But his other tweets suggested he’s holding some information back about his relationship with Charlotte that could change people’s perspectives on the whole scenario.

I'am baccccckkkkkkk !!! ✌🏼️

He topped these tweets off with a very unnecessary, sun-kissed, shiny torso portrait which his followers went mad for.

Gaz was originally reported to have embarked on a secret threesome with co-stars Olivia Walsh and Charlotte Dawson while shooting the latest series of MTV’s Ex On The Beach, which also starred his ex-girlfriend Lillie Lezie Gregg.

Oh dear! Charlotte Crosby has peed herself again – but while sober


Apart from his little Twitter outburst, Gaz doesn’t seem to bothered about
 utterly smashing Charlotte’s heart again
 after 
she called him her ‘partner for life’.


Seems like he’s been partying with the lads since getting back from the Ex On The Beach island according to this triptych of tweets:

Oi Oi back in the uk!!! Party time !!!

Why 
couldn’t he have lost his bag in a night club instead of poor Charlotte
?

Come on, Gaz, spill the beans about your on/off girlfriend and we might forgive you – in your most outlandish dreams, that is.
