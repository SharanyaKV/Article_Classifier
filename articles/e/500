It’s not everyday you get a portrait done of you, and Dame Barbara Windsor was the lucky recipient of one this week.

The EastEnders star was guest of honour at the unveiling at L’Escargot in Soho, London, on Wednesday and she seemed pretty happy with the reflection.

That is, until she turned her back to the cameras and gave the portrait a proper look.

Welsh artist Dan Llywelyn Hall did the portrait, though we’re guessing Babs won’t be asking for a copy for her own home.

She’ll be making her return to Albert Square soon along with onscreen son Ross Kemp, as Peggy and Grant Mitchell, but sadly she’s getting killed off for good.

Let’s hope EastEnders get her approval if they commission a painting of Peggy for the set, eh?
