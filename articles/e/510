Katie Price has got pretty frank about her sex life on Loose Women.

The former glamour model has revealed her magic number, kind of. It’s around the 10 mark apparently, as she admitted she can ‘count on my hands-ish how many…ish.’

During a segment where the Loose Ladies spoke about the age they feel is appropriate age for children to have their first boyfriends and girlfriends, Katie Price revealed she was 16 when she had hers.

She branded herself a ‘late developer’ for not having sex until then, and said it happened on her 16th birthday after an East 17 concert.

She said: ‘I was very late developing like that. My mum always said “don’t lose your virginity till you’re 16.”

‘I lost my virginity on my 16th birthday after an East 17 concert.’

Fellow panelist Gloria Hunniford then quipped: ‘Would it be fair to say you’ve made up for it subsequently?’

Shocked by the insinuation, Katie replied: ‘I haven’t had THAT many… I can count on my hands-ish how many…ish!’

As the segment was about first loves, Katie brought up her own son Junior’s ‘obsession’ with girls.

Turns out she’ll be pretty strict with the lad. She said: ‘He is already obsessed by girls. All his friends at school are. But I will be strict like my mum was with me.

‘For girls to come over, he will have to be 16 and for them to stay over, even older.’
