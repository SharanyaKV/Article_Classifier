Hollyoaks spoilers: Killer Silas Blissett MURDERS Kim Butterfield in shock twist?

This is the chilling moment that Kim Butterfield comes face to face with the most deadly man ever to come out of Hollyoaks (and that’s saying something!) – and you can bet that Silas Blissett’s intentions towards her are not honourable.

As Kim continues her online search for Gloved Hand Killer Lindsey following their last meeting where Lindsey attempted to get JJ from her, she agrees to meet a man called Edward – but it’s Silas who turns up.

Bringing information on Lindsey with him, Silas is clearly leading Kim into a trap – could Lindsey have put him up to it and is Kim about to find herself in serious danger?

Silas has had no qualms about killing young women before – and perhaps Lindsey felt that Kim was one of the few people she couldn’t finish off herself. So is Silas there to do the deed himself?

Or does he have something else in mind for Kim?

Myra McQueen and Sally St Claire should really learn to find more private places to have arguments about deep secrets – as one eavesdropper is about to discover the headteacher’s relation to John Paul.

After John Paul confides in Mrs St Claire about his relationship with Scott and how Myra made him feel ashamed of being with him, Sally confronts Myra and says that as John Paul’s mother figure, she really should be more supportive.

Later, Myra is furious when Sally turns up at a lunch she is having with JP and Scott and even more put out when she learns that it was John Paul who invited her. John Paul has told Sally they can have a professional relationship – but he doesn’t need another mother!

As John Paul and Scott head upstairs to hang out, Sally and Myra have a row over their shared secret – but someone overhears everything.

Will they blow Mrs St Claire’s identity?
