(this article contains spoilers for those who haven’t yet seen the final episode of Scott and Bailey)


It’s official folks. Scott and Bailey has closed its doors for good after the final ever episode aired on ITV.

And the series certainly bowed out with a bang, thanks to an episode which saw pregnant Rachel Bailey (Suranne Jones) wrapping up a murder case in the nick of time.

But it wasn’t before she almost became a victim herself after the killer lured her to a basement underneath a railway station – leaving her to fend off her would-be attacker as well as crack the case.

It all ended up with Rachel deciding to stay in Manchester instead of heading to London – while colleague Janet Scott (Lesley Sharp) got involved in her daughter’s own problems – as if things weren’t dramatic enough already.

But while the final episode did its best to tie up the loose ends, viewers were still pretty devastated that it’s not coming back.

A little bit heartbroken that tonight was the last ever episode of Scott and Bailey😭

Suranne Jones previously revealed that she was glad the popular show has finally drawn to a conclusion.

‘We said we weren’t going to do another one last series, and then when ITV said, ‘Would you like to do another one?’ she told the Radio Times.

‘We kind of thought [why not], because there’s been quite a break between the last one and this one.

‘And then I said, ‘Oh I’d quite like to produce as well,’ so they said yes come along and do that. So the whole thing was a goodbye in a sense.’
