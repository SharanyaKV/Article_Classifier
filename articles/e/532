So it doesn't come as a surprise that he has millions of followers worldwide. Two such fans happen to be our very own Riteish and Genelia Deshmukh. A recent photo posted by Riteish on Instagram show how elated he was when he met Travolta. Riteish posted a photo of himself with Vincent Vega (read: Travolta) and dedicated it to wifey-dearest Genelia. "John Travolta - pic I clicked for my Baiko @Geneliad - who is a huge fan- she says Grease, I say Face/Off (sic)," said the actor.

Whatever be their choices, we do wish that Travolta does an Indian film soon.
