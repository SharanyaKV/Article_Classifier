12 soap spoiler pictures: EastEnders and Coronation Street returns, Emmerdale revenge, Hollyoaks murder


When a soap legend leaves our screens, fans who have invested in them can’t help but miss them – but it’s a good week for returns, even if some of them are temporary. 


Top of the billing is EastEnders matriarch Peggy Mitchell – who is back to catch up with her closest friends but also to face up to her own mortality. As she is given tragic news, her family want her to fight – but has she actually given up?

Over in Coronation Street, it’s Roy Cropper who is back much to the joy of Carla and Cathy especially. But the homecoming joy is short lived when Roy and Cathy hit another obstacle in their relationship.

Elsewhere, Silas’ latest Hollyoaks return could spell danger for Kim.

Finally, in Emmerdale, the focus is on a final goodbye as locals say a final goodbye to their beloved friend Edna Birch and emotions run high for Sandy in particular.

Here are the latest pictures from the upcoming week of soap drama…
