Posh Neighbours At War viewers couldn’t get enough of red stripe lady Zipporah

Channel 4 aired a brand new TV show on Monday night, which followed the property battles of the wealthy.

Posh Neighbours At War followed the arguments of noisy Hampstead gardeners and issues with back garden operas, but it was the row over a red striped house that viewers couldn’t get enough of.

Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring’s decision to paint her house in the brash colour hacked off her neighbour, South African businessman Niall Carroll, and the documentary followed her legal war to keep the aesthetic of her home intact.

She told Times2 that she painted the place in stripes in protest against the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council’s refusal to allow her to change the property’s status to residential, as well as add a basement swimming point, despite Mr Carroll being allowed to add one to his home.


Twitter were quick to back Zipporah in her battle:


 

Loving Zipporah from Posh Neighbours at War is fabulous, I'd love to live next door to her. I think a candy stripped house is lush 😊

Have to agree with this one.


Tbh, I think it's very oppressive to expect a woman called Zipporah to live in anything other than a stripy house.
