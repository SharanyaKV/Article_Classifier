  When one of the hottest actors comes to town to perform on New Year's Eve, it is but natural that hordes of people throng the place. That's exactly what happened when Bollywood Sunny Leone descended on the city to give Hyderabadis a memorable evening to remember. And boy did she nail it right! Performing to her famous songs Pink Lips, and Baby Doll, she also shook a leg to Dhating Naach and had the crowd hooting and grooving along with her. Once the clock struck 12, the pretty actress came back on stage, along with her husband, Daniel Weber, wishing those present at the venue a happy new year. Now this is what we call the perfect dhamakedaar beginning to the New Year!
