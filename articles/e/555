In a night which was high on TV drama (EastEnders, Scott and Bailey et al), one programme reigned supreme on social media – but it wasn’t the one you’d expect.

Nope, the other small screen shenanigans gave way to BBC Two’s Caravanner of the Year, a show which – as the title suggests – saw avid mobile home enthusiasts battling it out for that prestigious Caravan Club title.

And honestly, viewers couldn’t get enough of it, as proceedings gently unfolded and audiences were hooked.

Here’s what people were making of it all…

Now then, would a second series be too much to ask?
