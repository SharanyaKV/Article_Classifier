Jon Snow was brutally murdered on the last season of the HBO fantasy series, leaving viewers on cliffhanger. Left to wonder about the fate of their favourite character, many had taken to speculating what would happen in the new season. Is he actually dead? Will he be resurrected? 


Actor Kit Harington, who plays the character, also added fuel to the fire by maintaining that Jon Snow was dead. But he also ended up on pictures taken at the set, fuelling further speculation about his life-or-death status.



But now, after episode two of the sixth season, fans are finally at peace. Read on if you want to know what happened. 










Snow was resurrected by Melisandre, a revelation that caps 10 months of worldwide speculation following Snow’s death at the hands of his Night’s Watch brothers in last year’s finale. 


Actor Kit Harington, who essays Snow on
