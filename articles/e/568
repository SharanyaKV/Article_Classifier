We don’t want to be the bearers of bad news – but Ricky Gervais has only gone and hinted that he might be about to retire David Brent.

The comedian’s Office alter-ego is set to return this summer in the movie Life On The Road, as he follows his dream of achieving musical stardom – but 
Ricky told Digital Spy
 that we may not be seeing him again after that.

‘This is David Brent now – what he’s doing now,’ Ricky explained.

‘There might be [things we] spin off from that – I want to bring an album out of the soundtrack and I want to do some live gigs, so he might pop up now and again.

‘But as a huge big project – a series of David Brent, or The Office, or another movie? Probably not.’

Boooooo. Still, at least we’ll have 
Life On The Road to look forward to
 when it opens in cinemas on August 19.

And we’ll always have Slough.

If you want to get your Ricky fix sooner than that you can also see him – not as David Brent – in Special Correspondents, which is available to stream on Netflix from April 29.
