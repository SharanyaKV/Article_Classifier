As if Game of Thrones wasn’t already hugely popular, anticipation for the latest season reached an all-time high with the TV series moving beyond George RR Martin’s book series.

The hype for the first episode of Season 6 was such that 60,000 UK fans tuned into Sky Atlantic's 2am simulcast on Monday morning, watching the episode at the same time as it aired in the States.

It’s estimated that 2.2 million UK viewers have watched the season opener via Sky – up on the 1.57 million viewers for the Season 5 premiere.

Following the 2am broadcast, 1.3 million Sky and Now TV subscribers streamed the episode on demand, while 0.8 million viewers watched the standard 9pm broadcast on Sunday night.

As well as being popular through official channels, huge amounts of people are thought to have seen the latest episode through illegal downloads.

According to 
Torrent Freak
, the season premiere was illegally downloaded a million times in just half a day – with a huge increase in the number of HD downloads in recent years.
