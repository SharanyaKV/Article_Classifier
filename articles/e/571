  For someone who shifted from doing a Bachelor's degree in science to doing a Masters in Drama, Shaunak's risk taking abilities are commendable. After doing some plays for college fests he has now acted in many plays including popular hit 'Preet Piyu Ne Panetar' and has also written and directed a number of plays. Shaunak found his calling as a theater artiste in college and made the decision to make his passion into his fulltime profession. "Initially it was slightly confusing, but when I realized that if I don't take this step now, I'd be working as a medical representative somewhere, collecting my salary and going home. Theater gave me a platform and made me a known face, I was not just making money but was also becoming famous. Had I been an MR, I'd never have done something I loved. Right then, the decision became easy." So what about the limited finances that Gujarati theater is known to have? "You must believe in yourself and the power of theater, you should be able to believe that doing plays will get you where you want to be, you will earn money and drive a car and live in a big house. To be able to survive in this industry, you should want to be in it badly. That's the only way I know."
