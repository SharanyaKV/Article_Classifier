Ryan Giggs ‘sent flowers and designer bags to PR girl’ behind wife Stacey’s back

Ryan Giggs reportedly sent a PR girl gifts behind his wife’s back in a fresh report following the news of the breakdown of his marriage.

According to The Sun, the ex-Manchester United player sent Kate Greville flowers and designer handbags, while they worked together on his £24million Hotel Football venture, last year.

It is suggested that this flirtation also contributed to Ryan’s split from wife Stacey.

‘The hotel was a big deal to him so he spent a lot of time working with Kate to get things right,’ a source told the tabloid.

‘He was very impressed with her and their friendship was very flirty. She started receiving gifts at the office, including designer handbags.’

Kate has reportedly ended her 18-month marriage to her Man United supporter husband to have a fresh start in Abu Dhabi.

Ryan and Stacey tied the knot in September 2007 and had previously endured a cheating scandal when he was linked to reality star Imogen Thomas and later with his brother’s wife, Natasha.

Now it is believed Stacey has begun divorce proceedings to end the marriage.


Metro.co.uk has contacted Ryan’s rep for comment.
