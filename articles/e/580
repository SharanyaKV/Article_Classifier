Ever since Beyonce dropped her new album Lemonade, every one, and I mean 
EVERYONE
 has been on the search for who Becky with the good hair is.

Because she gets a name check in Bey’s song Sorry, at the very end, and people have been throwing accusations left, right and centre about who it could be.

Rachel Roy 
got the brunt
 of the online abuse and harassment, followed by 
Rita Ora
, but The Daily Show’s Trevor Noah pointed out just why this Becky hunt is pretty sexist and one-sided.

‘People are going after this mystery woman like she tricked Jay Z into her vagina,’ Trevor says.

When a man cheats, we still focus on the "other" woman.

‘Like she just laid a trail of Yankees hats leading up to her bedroom for Jay Z to follow.’

So really the question really isn’t who Becky with the good hair is, because it could be one person, multiple people or a figurative person.

The one consistent thing in all this is Jay Z, Bey’s husband, who may or may not have cheated on his wife.

What we’re left with is one question for Jay, and I’ll leave Nicki Minaj to ask that one.
