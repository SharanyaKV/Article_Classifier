Let listeners judge my music: Ilaiyaraaja


Remember the book 
Love and Love Only
 in the Vijay-Shalini Tamil film 
Kadhaluku Mariyadhai
? Well, that’s the same title for an upcoming Indo-Australian film that talks about the realities of students’ lives in Australia. The highlight of this film, directed by Julian Karikalan, is that it has music by maestro Ilaiyaraaja. 


In a video released recently, the music director says, “I can say many things about composing for this film, like any other composers all over the world. But I won’t. Because everything is for the listeners – it is up to them to decide if it is good or not. I’d like them to decide if the music goes with the film or not.” 


Rohit Kalia plays the lead role, an IT professional who is sent to Australia through Infosys, in the film. While Georgia Nicolas plays the female lead, other actors who feature in it are Ambika Asthana, Shekhar Mehta, Sashi Dandekar, Suparna Mallick, Robert Osborne, Benjamin Cork, Juliana Peniazeva, Vikas Sehgal and Laurance Nath.
