Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney have teased a ‘mega-festival’

Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Bob Dylan and Roger Waters have all shared videos that appear to confirm rumours of a ‘mega festival’ this October.

Previous reports had suggested that the promoters behind Coachella were planning a once-in-a-lifetime festival on the same festival site between 7-9 – featuring all the above artists.

But they have now seemingly confirmed the rumours, after each act shared a short video which showed some of their classic performances – alongside the word ‘October.’

It’s also believed that Canadian singer Neil Young will also share the bill, but he is yet to share a similar video.

The Who’s Roger Daltrey also appeared to previously confirm the festival, saying: ‘I think it’s us and Roger Waters on the same day. It’s a fantastic day for a festival. It’s the greatest remains of our era.

‘I hope a lot of normal fans can get tickets before they get snatched up.’

As for the festival’s running order, reports suggest that two night will headline each night – with Bob Dylan and Paul McCartney on the first, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young on the second, and The Who and Roger Waters on the third.

Speaking about the festival, Neil Young’s manager Elliot Roberts told The LA Times: ‘It’s so special in so many ways. You won’t get a chance to see a bill like this, perhaps ever again. It’s a show I look forward to more than any show in a long time.’
