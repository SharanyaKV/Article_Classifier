  LONDON: Men who do household chores are more likely to marry a girl of their choice, and since British men are happy doing these chores, they score high, according to a study conducted by the University of Oxford.   The study suggests that if you want to settle down, your chances of getting married or living with someone are probably highest in Britain, the Scandinavian countries and the United States, where men more likely than their Australian counterparts to do the household chores and thereby make marriage a more attractive option to their nations' women.       According to an Oxford economist, marriage and cohabiting rates in developed countries can be linked to attitudes towards the roles of men and women, and views on who is responsible for doing the housework and looking after the children.       Both men and women have shown they are more likely to want a live-in relationship with the opposite sex if they think their partner will do a share of the housework and childcare duties.       The study constructs an 'egalitarian index' of 12 developed countries, based on responses to questionnaires about gender, housework and childcare responsibilities.       Norway and Sweden top the egalitarian index, with Britain in third place, followed by the United States.
