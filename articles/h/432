Hospital bosses today hailed “good planning and a Dunkirk spirit” for ensuring patients were kept safe during the first all-out junior doctors’ strike.

Attendances at London A&amp;Es were down by about 20 per cent yesterday as patients with minor ailments heeded advice to seek help elsewhere. 

NHS England said none of the city’s 28 A&amp;Es were forced to close or request temporary ambulance diverts, and no patient safety incidents were reported.

Consultants were back on the “shop floor” today as junior doctors again refused to provide emergency, maternity and critical care between 8am and  5pm. About 78 per cent of juniors due to work did not report for duty yesterday. 

Barts Health, which runs three east London A&amp;Es, said 117 of about 1,000 juniors turned up. St George’s in Tooting, one of the city’s four major trauma centres, saw about 330 patients, down from 380 to 400 on a typical weekday. Major incidents remained steady.

Hillingdon hospital saw 145 patients in A&amp;E, down from 170, while its urgent care centre treated 220, down from a typical 290 to 300. Chief operating officer Joe Smyth said: “Good planning and a Dunkirk spirit carried the day.

“The bit that has not been flushed out is the impact on the people whose operations we postponed.”

London Ambulance Service received 219 fewer calls than the previous Tuesday and attended 200 fewer incidents. It said: “While the number of immediately life-threatening incidents went up, we did see a 14 per cent decrease in the number of less seriously ill and injured people calling for an ambulance.”

Consultants pressed the Government to end the row. More than 100 signed a letter to NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh criticising his failure to tell Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt not to impose new contracts on juniors.
