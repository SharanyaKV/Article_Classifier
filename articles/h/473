Revealed: Brent named as London&apos;s &apos;fat capital&apos; for most obesity related hospital admissions

Brent has been named as London’s ‘fat capital’ with most hospital admissions for obesity than anywhere else in capital.

Last year, the borough recorded 3,015 medical appointments where obesity was either the main problem or their patient's weight was noted by doctors while being treated for another ailment.

The area had 940 hospital admissions per 100,000 people for obesity related problems – higher than the national average of 811. 

The figures from the 
Health and Social Care Information Centre
 also show obesity was a cause for concern in the boroughs of Harrow and Hillingdon.

Admissions per 100,000 people

Brent - 940

Harrow - 938

Hillingdon - 830

Enfield - 785

Islington - 754

Waltham Forest - 746

Hackney - 721

Ealing - 677

Barking and Dagenham - 618

Haringey - 617

In Harrow, 938 people per 100,000 were treated at hospital, while in Hillingdon the figure was 830.

However, the overall reading in London paints a far healthier picture, with some areas among the fewest hospital admissions in the UK.

In Richmond, just 238 people per 100,000 people were diagnosed as having an obesity problem while Kingston (252), Kensington and Chelsea (289) and Wandsworth (292) all saw fewer appointments than many areas across the country.

Last year there were 440,288 admissions at England's hospitals for obesity related health issues, compared to the 40,741 recorded in 2004/5.

The majority of obesity admissions, 73 per cent, were for female patients. 

Across the country, Wirral was shamed as Britain’s ‘fat capital’ with 9,286 appointments – 2,894 per 100,000 people.

Being overweight or obese is linked to a host of health problems including heart disease, cancers, diabetes and strokes.

Last August, it was reported childhood obesity rates were higher in London than the rest of the country with one in five children classed as very overweight by the time they leave primary school.
