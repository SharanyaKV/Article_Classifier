The former Leicester City boss has been discussed at length among the Parkhead hierarchy.


Express Sport
 understands that 
the Celtic board are still at the very early stages in their search for a new manager
.

They are compiling a list of options which majority shareholder Dermot Desmond will narrow down to a shortlist.

Pearson is to be sounded out to see if he would be interested in being considered for the Celtic job.

However, they could face a race against time to secure the 52-year-old’s signature as both Aston Villa and Middlesbrough are interested in hiring him - Pearson is currently favourite to take over at Villa Park.

Pearson has been out of a job since being sacked by Leicester in June 2015. He is credited with laying the foundations for their astonishing success this season, having assembled the team which is close to winning the Premier League title.

As well as Leicester, Pearson has managed Hull, Southampton and Carlisle. He has also had caretaker spells in charge of Newcastle, England Under-21s and West Brom.

David Moyes remains the bookies’ favourite to replace Deila, closely followed by Roy Keane, while Neil Lennon would love his old job back.

Steve Clarke and Malky Mackay have also declared their interest in the role since Deila confirmed he will step down at the end of the season.
