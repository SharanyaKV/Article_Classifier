Liverpool centre-back Mamadou Sakho deserves a lengthy suspension after failing a drugs test, according to Reds legend Dietmar Hamann.

Sakho tested positive for a fat-burning substance following the side’s Europa League tie with Manchester United last month.

The 26-year-old defender could receive a ban of up to two years but he has decided against challenging the results of the test.

‘I don’t think they should let him off with a minimum ban. He failed a drugs test and it is his fault,’ Hamann told talkSPORT.

‘As a player, you are warned on an almost daily basis. The doctor tells you: ‘if you do take anything, let us know because it could be eye drops, a nasal spray, there could be something in it that is banned.

‘I have got no sympathy for the guy and if he were to get a two-year ban I don’t think you could argue with it.’

Sakho’s  team-mate Kolo Toure was banned for six months back in 2011 while on Manchester City’s after testing positive for a weight-loss drug.
