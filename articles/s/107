Daniel Grimshaw had a moment to forget as Manchester City lost 3-0 to Chelsea in the second leg of the FA Youth Cup final on Wednesday evening.


With the scoreline at 1-1 on aggregate from the first leg, the young goalkeeper charged out of his goal to claim a long ball but horribly misjudged his positioning.

The blunder put Dujon Sterling through on goal for the Blues and he made no mistake from close-range to put his side 1-0 in front on the night.

Goals from Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori after the break put the tie beyond the Citizens at Stamford Bridge.

The victory means Chelsea have won the competition three years in a row – supporters of the London club will be hoping many of the youngsters progress into the first-team in the near future.
