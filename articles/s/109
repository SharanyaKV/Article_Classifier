Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas names Arsenal’s Mathieu Flamini as the best midfielder he’s played with

Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas has played with some of the very best midfielders in the game.

At Barcelona he played alongside Andres Iniesta, Xavi and Sergio Busquets.

With Spain he’s played with Xabi Alonso and at Arsenal he worked with Patrick Vieira.

So the 28-year-olds has no shortage of quality players to choose from when naming the best midfielder he’s ever played with.

And yet, he’s arguably chosen the most unlikely of the lot.

Mathieu Flamini.

That’s right. Forget Iniesta. Forget Xavi. Forget Vieira. It’s all about the hard tackling Frenchman.

He told Football Daily: ‘I had two years playing next to Flamini and he covered me.

‘He covers so much ground.

‘If I say Iniesta or Xavi – yeah it’s fantastic for the eyes but in real football it’s not real for me.

‘But if I had to choose one it would have to be between Gilberto Silva and Flamini.’

So there you have it. According to Fabregas, Flamini is the world’s best.
