  MIRPUR: Pakistan failed to fire at the Asia Cup but skipper Shahid Afridi believes his side can make amends at the upcoming World T20. In a chat with TOI, Afridi spoke about his team's chances, the innings he played in the 2009 World T20 final at Lord's and more. Excerpts:   How would you rate Pakistan's chances at the World T20?   Look, we made too many mistakes in this competition. Our batting hasn't fired and you can't win matches if you lose quick wickets right at the start of play. The middle-order and our bowling did keep us in the hunt, especially in matches against Bangladesh and India, but it wasn't enough. I still believe we have the team to go the distance (in T20 World Cup). It is a format where our boys have done well. We will have to do something special to make a mark because we are in a tough group with the likes of India, Australia and New Zealand.   Mohammad Amir's return has been a big boost...   Amir has been sensational and bowled his heart out each time he was given the ball. As a skipper, I can't ask for more. There was huge pressure on him when he came back into the side, but he has handled himself well and justified his selection.   Having been part of many India-Pakistan clashes over the years, where do you see your side falling short vis-a-vis India which has had an upper hand over you in recent years?   I believe India have been able to raise their game in crucial junctures, which we haven't. In the last game against India, we failed to read the pitch and made too many errors that cost us the game. We fought hard and made it tough for them, but when you don't have runs on the board the bowlers can't do much.   How much motivation do you derive from your exploits in 2009 at the World T20? Could you share any anecdotes from the knock you played in the final?   It was a massive moment not just for the team, but for those at the stadium cheering us, and for the entire nation. On the day of the final, there were butterflies in my stomach. I was supremely confident, and somehow knew we would do well. We didn't have a daunting total to chase, and vividly recall the six I hit against Muttiah Muralitharan towards mid-wicket. Even today, whenever I have some free time I catch that innings of my mine on the internet. That win remains the proudest moment for me till date.       How would rate Virat Kohli vis a vis Sachin Tendulkar?       I have said this before too - no one should be compared to Sachin Tendulkar. He has been a great role model for millions of Indians and for those who follow the sport across the world. Virat has been a champion player too. He has been consistent over the years and his aggressive nature is great for the game. Both are fantastic cricketers and I wouldn't put one above other.       In your opinion, who can be labelled as the best hitter in world cricket today?       There are quite a few such as Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, Virat, Glenn Maxwell, David Warner, and of course MS Dhoni among others. On a given day, these players are extremely destructive.
