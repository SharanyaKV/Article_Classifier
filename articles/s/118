  CHENNAI: Pace legend Glenn McGrath was part of a world-beating Australian side. Even after his retirement, the Aussies have won the ODI World Cup once, but the T20 World Cup has eluded them so far. McGrath, who is currently in Chennai to train the pacers at the MRF Pace Foundation, spoke about Australia's chances in the forth coming T20 World Cup. Excerpts:   Do you think the bowlers have developed new skills to rein in batsmen in T20s?   There has been a remarkable change in the way the bowlers are looking to go about their job nowadays. The bowlers have learnt to have better control and the margin of error has reduced.   What is safe total in a T20 game? Do you think the mindset of teams while chasing has completely changed?   Yes, the current generation shows no fear in chasing big totals. The attitude has changed. Earlier, 200 was a defendable total in 50-0ver games and now 300 is not. With the wickets becoming batsmen friendly, chasing down a big target has become easier.   Who, according to you, will be the favourites in the upcoming World T20?   India are the favourites. They play the format well and the conditions favourable. They can go all the way.   World T20 is the only title that has eluded Australia...   It can happen anytime as Australia take their T20 games very seriously .Australia generally play well in Indian conditions and I am sure they'll play with a lot confidence this time.   Have you seen India's Bumrah during the Australia series? What do you have to say about his unusual action?   Yes, I feel that the batsmen will keep facing difficulties in handling Bumrah if he consistently bowls those yorkers. He has got an unusual action and batsmen will need time to adjust to it. Bumrah trained here two years back and has improved a lot.     How do you evaluate Steven Smith's rise?       I am a big fan of Smith. He is not the conventional cricketer. Technically he may not be as good as others but he gets you the results, which is more important. I love his attitude and he is a very tough guy to bowl to. Skills can only get a batsman to a certain level. Attitude can make you a great cricketer and Smith has plenty of it.       Do you endorse Shane Warne's comment on Steve Waugh that he was a selfish captain?       (Smiles) They are excellent players and both are good friends of mine. As a captain, you have to take some tough decisions. Steve has been a great captain and has led the team by example. But yes, people comment differently and it was Shane's personal opinion. I must thank Shane for helping me form a good partnership and help me take so many wickets. Just like batsmen, we bowlers too have to bowl in tandem and I am lucky to have enjoyed a great partnership with Warne.
