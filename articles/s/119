  KOLKATA: Team India director Ravi Shastri harped on team effort as the hosts prepared in earnest for the World T20 championship.  "We don't talk about individuals. No individual can win you a big tournament... For that to happen, seven-eight individuals need to perform consistently," he said on Wednesday , the eve of the team's first warm-up match against the West Indies at Eden Gardens.  "Virat (Kohli) is in outstanding form, and so is Rohit (Sharma)... MS (Dhoni) has done well lower down the order, Yuvraj (Singh) has struck form, Shikhar (Dhawan) has had his moments," Shastri said while spelling out individual brilliance which has contributed to the team's phenomenal run this year in the shortest format of the game. Shastri felt it was good to have most of the big players in form going into the mega event.  "We have got into a good habit of winning games. You might get the odd hiccup on the way . But it's important to maintain a level of consistency and treat every game as an important game," Shastri said, pointing out the importance of warm-up games before the tournament.  After the West Indies game, India will play another practice tie, against South Africa in Mumbai on Saturday, before launching their WT20 campaign against New Zealand in Nagpur. Shastri believes the Indian team has now the right blend of youth and experience.  "Any good side needs balance between youth and experience. If you look at history, the world No. 1 sides would always have experience and youth. The youngsters bring energy to the table and keep the seniors on their toes while they too want to emulate the seniors," he explained.  The former India captain is actually happy to have a `good' headache of not being able to fit in players like Ajinkya Rahane and Harbhajan Singh in the playing XI regularly .  "That's the criteria of a good team -its bench strength," Shastri pointed out. "Players like Harbhajan and Rahane can get into any team in the world. So it's a good problem to have," he quipped.    Shastri was all praise for Kohli, who is in the midst of a fabulous run.      "Every time he bats, you can see passion written all over. You can see his body language, he just loves the big stage. He wants to compete against the best in the world," the former India captain said.      He took a dig at critics calling for skipper MS Dhoni's head.      "I've said long back that he (Dhoni) is the best. What else is left for him to be achieved... but there will still be people who want him to retire. This is normal in our country. You go after your champions," he lamented.
