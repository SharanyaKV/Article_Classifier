Leicester City’s Claudio Ranieri responded to a Chelsea fan letter asking who his favourite Muppet was

In 2004 I wrote to Claudio Ranieri and asked him who his favourite muppet was. I hope things are different now.

The Premier League may be full characters who could easily be described as “muppets”, but Claudio Ranieri isn’t one.

Chelsea fan Phil Lucas today posted the Italian’s response to a letter he sent in 2004, asking the then Blues boss the burning question: who is your favourite Muppet?

Never one to leave fans wanting, Ranieri took time out of a busy European and domestic schedule with the London club to respond in the politest way possible.

‘Unfortunately I do not have a favourite Muppet as I have never seen the show,’ he replied.

The letter also shows appreciation for the fan’s ‘kind comments’, coming at a time when Ranieri faced increasing speculation over his position at the club – eventually replaced by Jose Mourinho despite finishing second in the Premier League and reaching a Champions League semi-final.

However, it seems Ranieri is now set to have the last laugh as Leicester City boss, with his side only two points away from a previously unfathomable league title win.
