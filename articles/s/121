Burnley promoted to the Premier League after win over QPR

Burnley have been promoted to the Premier League after beating QPR 1-0 on Monday afternoon.

The Clarets, who were only relegated from the English top division last season, secured promotion after a goal from Sam Vokes in the 61st minute at Turf Moor which sent them to 90 points, above Middlesbrough.

Sean Dyche’s side were aware of what was needed after Brighton were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Derby in the earlier game which finished immediately prior to kick-off.

It was a cagey affair for Burnley, however, but Vokes’ header just after the hour mark settled the nerves and the Lancashire outfit held on for the crucial three points.

Alejandro Faurlin struck the woodwork for Rangers with 20 minutes to go but it was a rare tense moment for Burnley supporters.
