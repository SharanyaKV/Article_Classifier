Arsenal are weighing up a move for Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly in the summer transfer window, according to reports in Italy.

Koulibaly, who is regarded as one of the best defenders in Serie A, moved from Genk to Napoli in 2014 but is now being heavily linked with several Premier League clubs.


Il Mattino
 say the Gunners are keeping tabs on the 24-year-old ahead of a possible approach at the end of the season.

However, Napoli have inserted a £31.5m buy-out clause in Koulibaly’s contract so Arsene Wenger would have to splash the cash to bring him to the Emirates.

It’s understood Manchester United, Chelsea, as well as Barcelona, are also very interested in the Senegal international.
