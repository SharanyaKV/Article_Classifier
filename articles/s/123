  In his new calling as coach and mentor, Rahul Dravid is putting in the hard yards, sharpening the skills of young players and evolving as an instructor himself. After coaching the India ` A' and India Under-19 teams over the last year, he is now ready for his new stint as mentor of Delhi Daredevils. In a chat with TOI on the sidelines of the Daredevils' preparatory camp in the outskirts of Gurgaon, Dravid spoke about the modern breed of aggressive, in-your-face Indian cricketers, the pitfalls of instant fame and the effect of too much T20. Excerpts...   How does it feel to be addressed as Rahul sir' more often than not these days?   (Laughs) I like this part of the thing. More than coaching, I see this as building more than coaching, I see this as building a team, creating a culture of performance and seeing the talent we have. I have been retired for only 3-4 years. I am pretty young to this.   T20 was an unwanted format for some of the senior cricketers in your time. You chose not to play the inaugural World T20. Do you regret that decision? Have you warmed up to T20 now?   You don't regret. The Indian team won that World Cup. That was a youthful team and it changed the discourse of Indian cricket. If we (the veterans then) had played, we might not have won. The fact of the matter is that the best team played and the best team won. T20 has become a very serious game. There is a lot of time invested. For me, Test cricket will always remain the premium game. Other people will have a different view. However, I love being part of it.   The dynamics of the game have changed with the advent of T20...what are the pros and cons?   The good thing is the level of professionalism in the kids, the opportunities they get and the maturity level. The negative is that the pressure of competition has increased a lot. There are too many distractions for the kids compared to my time. Nowadays, it is very important to keep your head in spite of being successful early. The trappings of success come at a very early age.   Young batsmen like to attack right from the word go, even in the nets. Is that a culture shock for you?     As a coach, I realize I can't coach them as I was coached. I have to change. And that's the exciting part. I need to challenge my own thinking. The scoring rates are different now. People are playing all kinds of shots. It's incredible to watch some of the shots they play. They practice it too! They see their seniors doing it. They copy and practice it. I am learning fast and trying very hard to keep an open mind.       There is also a Virat Kohli doing things in an orthodox way while AB de Villiers does the exact opposite...     This is a performance-based game.How you achieve that performance, as history has shown, is sometimes a bit ir relevant. The only time you interrupt is when the performances are not there, people get dropped. AB de Villiers has a way of scoring runs and he is successful at that. Virat Kohli wants to do it differently and is still successful. Why would you want to change them anyway? Malinga bowls his yorkers in a particular way and Dale Steyn bowls his yorkers in some other way. It's for the player to realize what suits him best and choose his way.       Have you got used to do modern coaching methods?     I must admit, my shoulder isn't holding up well. I saw Gary Kirsten give throwdowns endlessly. I don't have a strong shoulder, I injured my shoulder. As a coach, your job doesn't end after the practice sessions. You have long days, strategizing and then handling media.
