  NEW DELHI: Rahul Dravid could be seen wearing a coach or a mentor's cap in the upcoming IPL season. The legendary batsman, who was associated with the suspended Rajasthan Royals franchise till last year, is in talks with Delhi Daredevils who have let go the services of Gary Kirsten this year.  It is learnt that Dravid is not averse to the idea of joining an IPL franchise after having finished a long season with the India `A' and India Under-19 teams. According to sources, talks between Dravid and Daredevils have reached an advanced stage.  "Dravid is keen to take up the role of a mentor but he is reluctant to be full-time coach. He has had a long season starting with the India 'A' team in June and he just got free after the ICC U-19 World Cup last week. He wants to spend more time with his family as well," a source close to the development told TOI adding that the only point of contention from Dravid's end is the amount of time he will be able to give to the franchise.    While Daredevils management didn't want to commit on his name, it did concede that Dravid was an option. A decision is likely to be taken in a fortnight. "Things are in a speculative stage. We have a few other names going around as well. Dravid is definitely one of them. At this point, it's difficult to commit as the owners of the team are not in the country. Once they return, a final call will be taken," a senior Daredevils official told TOI.      There is a theory going around that Dravid and the core of former Rajasthan Royals management helped Daredevils put together a revamped team this year. The team has a fair sprinkling of Rajasthan like Karun Nair and Sanju Samson who have been bought for high prices along with South African Chris Morris.       There are three players in Rishabh Pant, Khaleel Ahmed and Mahipal Lomror from the India U-19 team which played in the World Cup in Bangladesh. Khaleel was apparently hand-picked by Zaheer Khan who doubles up as player and bowling coach at Daredevils. "Zaheer has identified Khaleel as one with potential and he can be worked on during his stay with the franchise. Pant was being followed for six months since he played the U-19 challenger tour nament," the DD official revealed.      Under Dravid's captaincy, Royals made it to the last four of IPL twice. He also led the team to the final of the Champions League T20 in 2013.                       NEW DELHI: Rahul Dravid could be seen wearing a coach or a mentor's cap in the upcoming IPL season.
