  NEW DELHI: As an off-spinner, New Zealand's John Bracewell would not have turned too many heads in his heydays. But it is the 57-year-old's ability as a cricket coach that has left an impressive imprint on the sport.  In his coaching experience of over 30 years, Bracewell first guided English county side Gloucestershire to multiple one-day trophies and then played a big role in shaping the new-look New Zealand outfit from 2007 onwards. He dubbed himself a 'mad scientist' because he was never afraid to innovate. Bracewell is now coaching the Ireland national team and his first assignment is to guide them through the qualifying rounds of the ICC World T20.  Excerpts from an exclusive interview...    Q. You have billed yourself as a 'mad scientist' for your techniques as a coach. Can you elaborate?   That statement has to be taken in context. What I meant was that I threw innovative ideas at others like a 'mad scientist'. Take for example, during my second stint with Gloucestershire, I employed a 'power-hitting' coach Julian Wood for the first time because I understood it's importance in the T20 era. I have never been afraid as a coach to initiate innovativeness and never missed a chance to take a gamble.   Q. How would you analyse you three stints as coach with Gloucestershire, New Zealand and now Ireland?   They were all at different points of time when coaching methodology was very different. In my first stint with Gloucestershire, all I had was an analyst and support staff and it was the same with New Zealand. Ireland is a fresh experience as we have a young group of players with limited budget and resources. The aim here is to create a good team and hopefully ensure a full-member status.   Q. Talking about limited resources, what more does Ireland need to develop as a team?   The first thing we need in place is an 'A' programme which every full-member country has. In addition to it, we need personalised nets and training facility. The practice facilities in Dharamshala are just fantastic and way above anything we have back home in Ireland.   Q. After Ireland's performances in the 2011 and 2015 50-over World Cup, Ireland are no longer surprise packages. Do you think this is a disadvantage?     I expect this team to work like a unit. Someone like a Chris Gayle usually only wins a couple of games in a tournament. We need a couple of batters to click in a couple of games. There is genuine quality in the World T20 qualifiers and we are aware that we need to win three games to ensure qualification for the main event which is a tough ask. The addition of Boyd Rankin is very important because he has genuine pace. We have to remember that Boyd has been a Test cricketer - he has even taken part in an Ashes series.       Q. In your stint with New Zealand, what was your philosophy in dealing with someone like Brendon McCullum?     I have developed my coaching philosophy over a long time - over 30 years. Brendon (McCullum) is a very different player, the kind you get once in a generation. You have to give them a chance to spread their wings and that's what I did. See how Brendon spread his wings and dominated world cricket.       Q. You played cricket in the company of legends like Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee. How would you sum up contribution of someone like Crowe to New Zealand cricket?       I have the utmost respect for Martin. He and Richard were the two world-class cricketers in an otherwise working-class team. They set the benchmark for New Zealand cricket, professionalised it even. It was because of someone like Crowe that we were able to earn money from playing cricket. He has laid a platform from which every cricketer including McCullum has benefited.
