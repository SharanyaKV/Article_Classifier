Mauricio Pochettino promises Tottenham fans they will be at the top before moving to new stadium

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has promised fans his team will be on top when they move to their new stadium.

Having recently signed a new contract that will keep him at the club until 2021, the Argentine is aiming high before Spurs move to their new ground in 2018.

‘I’ve explained a lot of times that we are ahead in our project,’ said Pochettino ahead of their match with Chelsea.

‘I’m very happy with our squad but, yes, our aim is to arrive in the new stadium at the top and playing in the Champions League.

‘We need to be focused on finishing in a good position, with the title if possible. It is important all the focus is on football and trying to win games.

‘It is important we concentrate on working hard to continue performing well next season.’
