  KOLKATA: It's not often that a team goes into a major tournament without any specific areas of concern. Team India are in that enviable position as they prepare for the World T20 championship with the first of two warm-up games, against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, here on Thursday evening.  Having won back-to-back T20 series against Australia and Sri Lanka, followed by their sixth Asia Cup triumph with an all-win record last Sunday, the Men in Blue will look to maintain their remarkable momentum and consistency.  India have a settled unit with all the batsmen among runs and youngsters Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya bowling well in tandem with veteran Ashish Nehra. On Thursday, though, the focus will be on Mohammed Shami, who was ruled out of the Asia Cup with a knee injury.  The nippy right-arm medium-pacer's match exposure since last year's World Cup has been limited to a couple of domestic T20 matches for Bengal and a few club games.Yet, the team management has not given up hope and is trying to get him ready before India's tournament opener, against New Zealand in Nagpur on March 15. Team direc tor Ravi Shastri made it amply clear that the pacer is very much in India's scheme of things. "He will be playing tomorrow and we will have a look at how he goes," he said on Wednesday.  Mahendra Singh Dhoni did say recently that it will be difficult to accommodate Shami in the playing XI, given the form of the quick bowlers. But the skipper and other members of the think tank will be wary of possible injury issues which could rule out any member of the regular playing XI anytime. Thus, it will be a big boost for Team India if Shami is declared fit for the tournament. "He will have to prove his fitness and the physio is working with him," Dhoni had said.    The Bengal pacer bowled for more than half an hour at nets during the team's practice session at Eden on Wednesday afternoon.      He took it easy to start with, before bowling from his full run-up and at his usual pace not long after. He shared one of the nets with Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Pandya, as the trio bowled to Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli. He dislodged Rohit's off stump once as Shastri watched from behind. He tried the yorker a few times, which was appreciated by Kohli.      Nehra left the ground with an ice pack wrapped around his right knee. There was no official word on his fitness, and it remains to be seen whether the left-arm pacer plays on Thursday. The West Indies squad did have a weeklong camp in Dubai, but the two warm-up games here (the second one will be against Australia on Sunday) will give them the chance to finalise the combination for their opener, against England.      Most of the players in this Caribbean side play T20 across the world in different leagues and have the potential to create a flutter if they can gel as a unit. Skipper Darren Sammy will look to do just that in the warm-up ties before going into the tournament proper.
