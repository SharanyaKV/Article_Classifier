One punter made the "worst cash out decision in history" after taking a 45p return on a 5000/1 bet on 
Leicester City
 winning the 
Premier League
.

The bettor withdrew from the race to win the £2,500.50, and will be disappointed that he failed to stay in the contest along with title challengers Tottenham and Arsenal.

The unnamed participant staked 50p on the Foxes taking the title at the beginning of the season, and stood to win £2,500 had they let the bet ride.

But instead they decided to take a 45p return after just the first game of the season, which Claudio Ranieri's men won 4-2 against Sunderland.

Some punters who backed the Foxes at similar odds have cashed out for thousands of pounds, with the highest payout being £72,000 settled on a £50 bet in March, Ladbrokes said.

The Foxes are in the driving seat in the Premier League race after Spurs’ shock draw against West Bromwich Albion, with a win in their match against Manchester United away at Old Trafford on Sunday securing the title.

As a consolation, the bookmaker has asked the customer to come forward to offer them a pair of tickets to a game next season plus a free bet on any team to win the 2016/17 title.

A Ladbrokes spokesman said: "This will go down as the worst cash out decision in history.

"Plenty of 5000/1 backers took sums midway through the season when it looked in the balance, but we wonder what our man didn't like about the 4-2 win on the opening day of the season."
