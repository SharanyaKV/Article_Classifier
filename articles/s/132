   Forward Kobe Bryant compiled 17 points, nine assists and eight rebounds as the Los Angeles Lakers snapped a four-game losing skid with a 97-85 victory over the Detroit Pistons at Staples Centre on Sunday.    Guard Jordan Clarkson also had 17 points for Los Angeles (2-8) as Bryant made just 6-of-19 shots from the floor but was effective in involving his team mates.    Guard Nick Young came off the bench to score 13 points for the Lakers, whose only other victory was over the Brooklyn Nets. Centre Roy Hibbert chipped in 12 points and seven rebounds.    Despite suffering a woeful start to the new season, the Lakers defeated the Pistons for the seventh consecutive time and the 10th time in the past 11 meetings.    Reserve guard Spencer Dinwiddie scored 17 points for the Pistons (5-5). Centre Andre Drummond extended his streak of double-doubles to 10 in a row with 17 points and 17 rebounds, but he and the Pistons saw their losing streak reach four games.    Los Angeles was clinging to a 78-74 lead after a dunk by Drummond on an alley-oop pass from Reggie Jackson with 7:28 remaining but the Lakers scored seven consecutive points, starting with a three-pointer by Bryant with 3:44 left.    That sealed the outcome as Detroit got no closer than eight the rest of the way.      The Lakers led by as many as 11 in the first half before taking a 48-44 lead at the break. They held the Pistons to 39.6 percent shooting while making 43.2 percent of their shots.        The Lakers also had the edge in free throws, making 12-of-18 (66.7 per cent) attempts to only two of three for the Pistons.        The teams entered the final period tied at 66-66.        Overall, Los Angeles converted 41.3 percent of its shots compared to only 36.5 percent for Detroit. Both teams struggled from behind the three-point stripe. The Lakers made just six of 19 (31.6 percent) to 25.9 percent (seven of 27) for the Pistons.      The Lakers prevailed despite committing 16 turnovers to 12 for the Pistons.
