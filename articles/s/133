  NEW DELHI: Saturday was a happy night for English sports fans -the cricket and football teams won on the back of some great performances by their Gen X. If you had Jamie Vardy and Harry Kane on the football turf, there was Jos Buttler and Joe Root leading the English charge in WT20.  One English batsman that every team fears and even the IPL head-hunters have come to appreciate is Jos Buttler. The Somerset wicketkeeper is without a doubt the most `destructive' in this England lineup, a fact even former captain Michael Atherton acknowledges.  "When Buttler is in at the end of the innings, in for the last five or six overs, he is unstoppable. No matter who is bowling at him, he is a real threat. He is one of the most destructive players in the game, and it's a long time since England could say they've got one of those," Atherton told a British channel.    Not only Atherton but his Somerset mentor Brian Rose believes Buttler is as destructive as Ian Botham."He has always had the same ability as Botham, one of the cleanest strikers of a cricket ball. He has a similar ability like Ian to hit the ball hard without any real effort," Rose told the Independent newspaper recently .      The 25-year-old's power needs to be seen to be believed. He gives it a fearful wallop both down the ground and square of the wicket. But it's his finesse with the paddle and ramp strokes that give him a 360-degree arc much like AB de Villiers.      "I don't get caught up in the occasion. There are not many surprises with me now as I like to take the emotion out of it. I am focussed on my skills and trusted myself that if I watched the ball I can react and make things happen," Buttler said after his man-of-the-match winning 66 off 37 balls on Saturday night against Sri Lanka.      Buttler is one of the few Englishmen who have bagged an IPL contract, Mumbai Indians snapping him up for Rs 3.8 crore. His power game has already brought him two of the fastest ODI tons for England over the last year. "I felt like I played well to get us up to a good score, but with Angelo (Mathews) chasing it down it turned out to be a fantastic game. We didn't adapt (to the conditions) against Afghanistan very well, but today we were a lot better," he said.
