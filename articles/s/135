Liverpool will have to breach Villarreal's El Madrigal fortress to take any advantage into their Europa League semi-final second leg.

The Spaniards, who have already knocked out Napoli and Bayer Leverkusen on their way to the last four, boast a perfect record at home in Europe with six wins and they have conceded just one goal in the process.

Liverpool, who are the first team ever to have gone 12 games unbeaten in a single Europa League campaign, must keep a close eye on Congolese striker Cedric Bakambu, who has scored nine goals in this season's tournament. Bakambu is 
11-2
 with BetVictor to break the deadlock and 2-1 to score at any time.

The hosts, who have failed to win any of their previous 10 games against English opposition, are 
6-4
 favourites to win the first leg, with Liverpool 2-1 and the draw 
9-4
. You can get 
17-20
 on both teams scoring and 1-2 on Jurgen Klopp's side reaching the final.
