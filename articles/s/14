Harlequins propr Joe Marler has been handed a two-week ban after being cited for kicking Grenoble hooker Arnaud Heguy during last week's European Challenge Cup semi-final.

The England international grappled with his opponent on the floor before making contact with Heguy's head as he made his way from the scene of the incidnet.

Marler, who was making his comeback appearance after serving a two-week suspension for his 'Gypsy boy' comment against Wales' Samson Mee in March's Six Nations game, will now be sidelined until May 9.

A statement from European Professional Club Rugby said that a three-man panel determinedÂ the offence was "at the low end of World Rugby's sanction and selected four weeks as the appropriate entry point."

However, Marler's recent disciplinary mater was then adjudged to have been of an "entirely different nature" before a two-week punishment was imposed.

The ban means that Marler will miss Harlequins' remaining two regular season Premiership games against London Irish and Exeter but he will be available for selection for the Challenge Cup final clash with Montpellier.

Marler will also be available for England's three-Test summer tour to Australia but his latest misdemanour could put his place in the squad in doubt if it is not looked upon kindly by coach Eddie Jones.
