  NEW DELHI: Two years ago, the Delhi Police special cell was listening into a few calls being made from Pakistan to Dubai. They had little idea that they were on the verge of unearthing one of the biggest rackets in Indian cricket.    On March 26, 2013, one of the callers (923333206****) mentioned words like "league", "over" and "rates". The cops, especially the then  commissioner of police Neeraj Kumar, got suspicious as the underworld men were discussing cricket in such detail and decided to dig further.      It turned out that as many as three players of Rajasthan Royals were involved in something called "spot fixing", the new way to fix matches in intervals. The mammoth operation involving the police agencies of Mumbai and Rajasthan as also the Enforcement Directorate led to the arrest of over 50 people in different states, including players, their agents/managers and bookies.

Around 9.32pm on the aforementioned date, a Pakistan-based caller spoke to someone in Dubai for 108 seconds. Delhi Police, with the help of intelligence agencies and Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), got the caller's voice examined through layered voice analysis tests and found it to be that of none other than Dawood Ibrahim.    Dawood was using code words in the calls with his aide, later identified as Javed Chautani. Later, a Delhi bookie, Ramesh Vyas, also got a call from the same number.

This method involves fixing parts of the match — say, players being asked to give away a pre-determined number of runs in a given over — to affect the verdict.    The first instance of spot fixing was established on May 5 in a Pune Warriors versus Rajasthan Royals match. On May 9, inspector Badrish Dutt of the special cell registered an FIR in this connection. A day later, Dutt was found dead along with his girlfriend in his Gurgaon flat in what is believed to be a murder-suicide.

Six days later, pacer S Sreesanth and two other Rajasthan Royals, bowlers Ajit Chandila and Ankeet Chavan, were arrested from Mumbai in a clandestine operation by a Delhi special cell team.
