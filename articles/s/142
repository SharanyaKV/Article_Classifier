Chelsea are interested in completing the summer transfer of Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Borussia Dortmund, reports say.

The 27-year-old Armenian midfielder was formerly a target for Liverpool.

The attacker has scored 18 goals this season for Thomas Tuchel’s side, forming a lethal partnership with Marco Reus and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

But according to 
the Mirror
, Chelsea will attempt to lure the midfielder to Stamford Bridge, despite the fact that they will be without Champions League football next season.

Mkhitaryan scored the opening goal in Dortmund’s recent 4-3 defeat at Liverpool, a result which saw one avenue to the Champions League close for the German side.

But Dortmund are currently second in the Bundesliga, seven points behind Bayern Munich and remain on course for a return to Europe’s top table next season.

Meanwhile, despite improved results since the return of Guus Hiddink, Chelsea are ninth in the Premier League, 17 points off fourth-placed Arsenal.
