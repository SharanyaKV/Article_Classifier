Manchester City are reportedly hopeful of signing four players in this summer’s transfer window as they prepare for life under Pep Guardiola.

The Bayern Munich boss is set to take over ahead of next season, and three priority targets have already been set as the club looks to challenge for both the Premier League and Champions League.

City are flying high in Europe under Manuel Pellegrini this season, with it all to play for as they go into their semi-final second leg against Real Madrid after last night’s goalless home draw.

But their domestic campaign has been disappointing, and 
The Times
 claim they want to sign Ilkay Gundogan, John Stones, Aymeric Laporte and one more this summer.

Talks are already under way over Gundogan – although the club are currently only offering £13.95million for the Germany international – an offer Borussia Dortmund are unlikely to accept.

Guardiola won the Champions League twice during his time at Barcelona, and is no stranger to spending big on marquee signings to secure success.
