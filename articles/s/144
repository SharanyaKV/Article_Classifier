  DHAKA: Still hurting from the one-run loss to India in last month's ICC World Twenty20, Bangladesh batsman Mahmudullah said it was his "senseless mistake" that led to the team's defeat in the heart-stopping game.  Chasing 147, Bangladesh were going along fine before a late slump proved disastrous. Mahmudullah was expected to take the team home with two runs required off as many balls but the senior batsman attempted a six that was caught at the boundary, leaving the side in a lurch.  "There was still hope ... but it didn't happen, it's actually my fault. I made a senseless mistake and was responsible for the defeat," Mahmudullah told 'bdnews24.com'.  "I just want to say - I apologise to everyone. I am yet to say officially something after that match. I will try to handle such situation smartly in the future."  The 30-year-old said the loss haunts him even now.      "How can I forget that? When Mushfiq and I were batting ... never thought that we could lose," Mahmudullah said.      "Actually Mushfiq's wicket after two fine boundaries was unthinkable. After that, my dismissal was unimaginable as well - it was such a mistake."      Mahmudullah said he has learnt his lessons and would look to play safe if faced with a similar situation in future.      "The ball was there to be hit for sixes but I missed. But I can't go back and fix it. In the future, I will try to choose safer options in such situations," Mahmudullah said.
