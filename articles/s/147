  The Asia Cup will be played for the first time in a Twenty20 format. Pakistan bowling legend Wasim Akram, who is in Bangladesh to do commentary for Star Sports, says he's looking forward to the India-Pakistan clash and the tournament.   Excerpts from an interview:    India and Pakistan will finally get to face each other in the Asia Cup...   Yes, that'll be a good game to look forward to and given the way India are playing right now, they're clear favourites. The Asia Cup, this year, assumes a lot of significance particularly because of the Twenty20 format that it'll be played in. It was a very sensible decision on part of the Asian Cricket Council. Out of the last three World T20 champions, three are participating in this Asia Cup, so that quotient alone adds so much excitement to the tournament. Then, Bangladesh have been an unbeatable side at home. This edition has a lot of potential and will help teams pick their best combinations for World T20.   The Indian pace bowling has been a struggling unit. Either injuries or lack of direction...   The primary reason is that India has failed to guard its bowlers. First of all, there are just too many people that a bowler is talking to. The BCCI has to be very strict about it and clearly tell the bowlers that they can only go to a certain academy or a BCCI-appointed coach and over there they should interact only with specified coaches with regards to their bowling. The more you start taking advice from multiple people, the more likely you are to enter a state of confusion. I strongly feel that's exactly what happened with Irfan Pathan. the last six or seven years there've been so many Indian bowlers who, when they arrive at the international stage, bowl at 140-145 kmph and in a year or two, the pace just dips.         How healthy a sign is it when bowlers try different things without the right guidance?    I'm all for changing actions. But what's more important for me is that if a bowler's got pace and can swing the ball, then I won't mess with his action. Because that action has been part of the bowler's regimen for a while and the muscles have got accustomed to that action. If you change the action, you not only stand to lose pace but the swing too.   You shortened your run-up after settling down at international level...   Yes, I shortened my run up long after I had settled down in international cricket. 1987 to be precise. Please remember that there was someone like Imran Khan around when I did that. But let me tell you that it was me who realised it about my action than someone else telling me. I realised I was taking 25 strides to the crease and bowling at a certain pace or managing to swing the ball which I could do with just 20 strides.   Mohd Shami is struggling with his fitness...   I can say I have some idea of fast bowling (sic). When I came to know that Shami was making a comeback for the tour of Australia last month, I told one of my co-commentators, I think it was Harsha, 'You wait and watch, this guy will probably pull his hamstring'. That's because the pressure of bowling in a practice game or in the nets or in a domestic game is different and the pressure of bowling in an international match is different. You need to properly play a full season of first class cricket after a knee injury before international cricket.         A fast bowler has got to keep thinking for himself...    Exactly. You're bowling on a flat wicket. There are two settled batsmen at the crease. What do you do? Simple, use your brains...look at the conditions, look at the situation and apply your mind. How would you put it in Hindi or Urdu, chalaaki (cunningness?)...you have to fox the batsman.   Does a format like Twenty20 allow you that space to think?   If it's the last ball of a Twenty20 match, many times the bowler is mentally prepared that he's going to be hit for a four or a six. And yet, you see bowlers bowling the middle line or the middle and leg. For me, the last ball of an innings was the most important delivery of an innings.   Has the bowler failed to innovate in cricket like the batsman has?   First of all, reverse swing has completely gone out of the picture. Reverse swing is an art that has not been preserved. It's an art cultivated not just by the bowler but an entire team. It's not rocket science but nobody wants to apply mind to it. Nobody will hand you a 'prepared' ball. You just have to see if it's a dry square and after six-odd overs tell your team to give you (the bowler) a one-bounce throw. If the ball lands on the rough side, it'll rough up further and you see the signs of the ball reversing a bit, you give a shout to your teammates to 'look after the ball'. How do you then look after the ball? You just let the rough side be and keep shining the smoother side. Only one guy should shine the ball, not the whole team.   Zaheer was the last of Indian bowlers who reached the next level?   Zaheer Khan was the last Indian bowler who managed to create this balance. He became a very intelligent bowler over a period of time. He tried different things. He got a good hang of the reverse swing. He would hide the shining side of the ball, like I did, when he ran in to bowl. Nobody told Zaheer all this. He learnt this by himself.   Umesh Yadav has good pace but doesn't seem to be doing things the right way...   I always liked his action but I don't think he had any mentor in this team. When I was inexperienced, I needed someone at mid-on or mid-off to constantly keep talking to me. I'm lucky I had Imran around. Later, there was Waqar, then Shoaib and it was about constantly talking to each other. Unfortunately, the Indian bowlers have always missed out on that. When they get hit, they don't know what to do. They just end up fending for themselves.   Are Indian bowlers missing out on the county experience?   It's okay if the Indian players can't play Twenty20 in England. But missing out on the county experience is a pity. I played a full 10 years for Lancashire. My stint at Lancashire allowed me to adapt to various things as a bowler which I couldn't have learnt playing first-class cricket in Pakistan.       You say Lancashire stint helped you more than anything else. Can you talk us through that experience?       In Lancashire, I used to spend most of my time alone. I used to go to the ground, 'prepare' my own ball and try my hand at reverse swing for hours and hours alone. There used to be this Sussex batsman Gehan Mendis. I used to take him to the nets and make him face the bowling. All my teammates used to say, 'Are you crazy? You've got an entire season in front of you. Don't exhaust yourself'. And I would tell them, 'Mate, I'm just 21. You don't get tired at 21. You only improve.'       Bowlers can bloom late in their careers, like Zaheer...       Of course. Zaheer learnt it by himself and the confidence showed in his bowling. I did the same. That's what I'd like to tell the youngsters of today. Close your eyes and picture Malcolm Marshall. Personally, I grew up with a mental state of mind that I had to bowl like Joel Garner. I never knew what a gym was till very late. I just ran and ran and ran and bowled.                                                             The Asia Cup will be played for the first time in a Twenty20 format.
