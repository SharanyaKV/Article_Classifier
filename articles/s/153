Claudio Ranieri insists that 
Leicester
's 
Premier League
 title race with 
Tottenham
 is not over yet, but concedes that his side are 'so very close' to glory with just a win needed to become champions.

Tottenham's 1-1 draw against West Brom at White Hart Lane on Monday night leaves Leicester seven points ahead of Spurs with just three games left to play.

The Foxes now need one win from their remaining matches to be crowned champions just a year after escaping from a sensational relegation battle.

Victory against Manchester United on Sunday would clinch the title, though Ranieri - who will be without top scorer Jamie Vardy at Old Trafford due to an FA ban - is refusing to accept that Spurs are no longer a threat.

Eurosport reports him as saying: "We are so very close. Everybody says it's done. In my opinion, no. I believe only in the mathematics.

"It is important to try to win every match. Every match. I don't know when, but it is important to get this goal [the title].

"I said to them [the players], 'We have to play as an XI... It's not important the name of your opponent, it is important what you do during the match and [to] help each other.'"

A number of Leicester stars were selected in the PFA Team of the Year, with Wes Morgan, N'Golo Kante, Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez all making the cut.

Mahrez also lifted the main PFA Player of the Year award after scoring 17 league goals and creating another 11 to cap a superb season at the King Power Stadium.

Ranieri said of the 25-year-old Algerian: "I am very proud because Riyad is a very humble man.

"He asks every time, 'What can I do to improve?' That is fantastic.

"He is a genius, our light. But I want to say also [that] all the players are having a fantastic season, with very great professionalism."
