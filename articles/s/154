Are Burnley the new Leicester? Clarets at 5000/1 odds to win Premier League title after Championship promotion

Burnley have odds of 5000/1 to win the 
Premier League
 title next season - similar to the odds prospective champions 
Leicester City
 had last year - after the Clarets secured promotion back to the top-flight on Monday.

Burnley's 1-0 win over QPR at Turf Moor, courtesy of a Sam Vokes header in the 61st minute, ensured the club sealed their place in the Premier League for next season at the first attempt.

Burnley will be crowned Championship winners if they beat relegated Charlton in their final fixture of the campaign, with the Clarets now having odds of 5000/1 from Bet Victor to go on and win the Premier League when they return to the top flight next season.

Leicester City, who narrowly avoided the drop last year to sit within just two points of winning the Premier League, also had odds of 5000/1 to go on and secure the trophy this season.

And Clarets fans are likely to be hoping that Leicester's good fortunes in the Premier League rubs off on their team when Burnley return to the top flight next term.
