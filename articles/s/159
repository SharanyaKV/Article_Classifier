  The moment the Rajya Sabha nominations are mentioned to MC Mary Kom, the boxer finds it hard to hide her excitement. "It's an honour for me. I didn't expect it. I was focusing on my upcoming competitions and performing better. I don't want to think too much (about the nomination), as I am focused right now on qualifying for the Olympics," she says, after regaining her composure.   She adds, "I had met Amit Shah (BJP president) in Delhi. I thought he wanted to wish me luck for the upcoming competition and discuss sports. I was surprised when he asked for my biodata for the nominations. Though I had to remain tight-lipped until the nominations were announced, I kept thinking, 'How did this happen?' But I will serve my country - be it as a boxer or as a parliamentarian. Also, in every field, you need to believe in yourself and do things with confidence. I have always challenged the norm. I have continued competing despite being a mother. Which man in the country has been a world champion five times?" Mary adds that if she joins politics, she will address issues that various sports face, not just boxing.

"The Olympics are easier compared to the World Championships. In the Olympics, you compete with only a selected few; if you are lucky, you will get opponents who are not so strong in the draw and your road to the final might be easy. Yet, in general, boxing is not easy - you don't get a second chance. It's all over in one match," she says.       Ask her if the nomination means she might be retiring, and she says, "I have said that after the Rio Olympics, I might retire. But now, I don't know. I feel strong. I might continue for some more time."      On the growing popularity of boxing as a subject for filmmakers, the 33-year-old from Manipur explains, "What films show is fake action. In the boxing ring, you have the real action. The pain and blood is real, much like it is in martial arts. But it is ironic that it was the action films of Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and Jet Li that inspired me to take up boxing. Now, sadly, I don't have time to watch many movies."
