  The Buddh International Circuit resembled a giant carnival as trucks, singers, dancers, and thousands of fans thronged the arena for a truck racing event, a vibrant event in which Indian and international truck racers competed on the track.      A number of stars visited the track to soak in the action and wish luck to the truckers. Cricketer Virender Sehwag interacted with the Indian drivers before the race, and said, "It's a sport of focus and risk and I am happy to see that Indian participants are here as well. This is not just entertaining but draws huge crowds as well." Narain Karthikeyan, the first Indian to race in Formula One, also made a comeback to the Buddh International Circuit, albeit as a spectator. "It's great that they have brought Indian drivers this time. The atmosphere is great and I love the buzz around here," he said.      The cultural performances drew applause as a number of stars performed on makeshift stages atop trucks in the middle of the race track. The opening ceremony saw artistes displaying Oriental, Brazilian as well as ethnic Indian dance forms. Neeti Mohan kicked off the show by singing some of her hits, getting a capacity crowd in the grandstand to sing along. Rapper Badshah brought the house down with tracks like DJ Wale Babu and Chull. An energetic song and dance routine by singer Garima Yajnik capped the evening. Talking about the event, Neeti said, "I've never performed at something like this. The energy was crazy and the atmosphere electric. I wasn't expecting something of this scale, but this was tremendous."      There was plenty of racing action as well. For the first time, the event featured Indian drivers, with the aim of taking Indian truck racing to the world. Twelve Indian drivers competed in two eight-lap races, with Jagat Singh and Nagarjuna winning their respective races. Union minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy gave away the awards to the winners. The race also saw participation from 12 international truck racers in a 20-lap final feature race. In the absence of defending champion Stuart Oliver, British racer David Jenkins pipped the duo of Richard Collett and Graham Powell to win the third season of the championship. Numerous collisions between Collett and Powell on the final laps helped Jenkins win his first title in India. Crashes and collisions were not uncommon in the event - Mat Summerfield, a hot favourite, lost seven places after his truck spun on a corner. Rohan, a racing enthusiast, said, "This was the perfect event because there was something for everyone. My girlfriend came here for the performance, and I came for the racing. Can't wait to be back here next year!"
