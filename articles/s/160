   Bengaluru:   Sunil Chhetri is a man who hates to lose — whether it is while leading the national football team and Bengaluru FC on the field, or while playing wagers with his teammates on his PlayStation. On Monday, however, Chhetri had a daunting task ahead of him that would challenge that trait — to win a point against the queen of Indian badminton, Saina Nehwal.    "I hope she takes it easy," Chhetri said, as he sauntered in to the Karnataka Badminton Association courts. Saina had just finished cooling down after her morning practice session, but was more than happy to oblige the Indian captain for a quick sparring game.    Chhetri, surprisingly, had all the right moves for a footballer who dabbled in badminton. In February this year, he had teamed up with Tarun Kona to take on India's top doubles stars Ashwini Ponnappa and Jwala Gutta and left onlookers impressed. This time too, Chhetri didn't disappoint.    Beginning slowly with long rallies, the 30-year-old began leaping into smashes and powerful returns to unsettle his Hyderabadi opponent. Saina, however, stood rooted to her spot, calmly returning each shot with a smile. "It's not turning out as I thought," Chhetri huffed.    But finally, the BFC striker did get a breakthrough, launching into a stray shot from Saina to finish with a venomous cross-court return. Chhetri let out a cry of triumph and a smiling Saina looked a bit ruffled. "Aapne toh shuttle hi tod diya (You've broken the shuttle)," the 24-year-old quipped.      What followed was something that Chhetri probably had coming for him. The world No. 4 showed a glimpse of her real game, raining down smashes after smashes on Chhetri as the Blues skipper bravely stood his ground. "The last one went right through me," he said, as Saina's thundering shots whizzed past him.        Chhetri finally called it quits, shook hands, congratulated Saina and handed her a personalized Bengaluru FC home jersey. "We are proud to have you as part of the BFC family. You must come to watch our matches and support us," he told the shuttler.        Saina was in awe of Chhetri's talent in the sport. "I never expected he would play so well actually. He has good wristwork and nice smashes, mainly because he's powerful player. Obviously it will help both of us if we keep playing like this together, because both our games involves a lot of running," she said.        So will this new association get her hooked to football? "I'm not a big fan of football. If I had to pick a favourite player, I'd say Cristiano Ronaldo because he looks good (laughs). But now after getting this beautiful jersey, I'll try my best to keep track of BFC's progress and support them. It feels great to be part of the team," said Saina.
