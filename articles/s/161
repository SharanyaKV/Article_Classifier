  BENGALURU: Between the before and after phase, comes transition, a period which is often uncomfortable. This is a phase the current Sri Lanka team is going through.  Off the 16 T20 matches they have played since their 2014 World T20 title triumph they have managed to win only five, their latest defeat, by a crushing seven-wicket margin against West Indies on Sunday night does not augur well for the Island nation. As the illustrious Mahela Jayawardne and Kumar Sangakkara, both of whom played their last T20Is in 2014, walked into sunset last year, they left a huge void which the Sri Lankans have struggled to fill.  An injury-prone Lasith Malinga's absence from the team and the indifferent and inconsistent form of Tillakaratne Dilshan haven't smoothened the change of guard either. The spin wizards and the men who made playing spin easy are not a part of the Lankan roster anymore.  The team's head coach Graham Ford is confident the current team will turn the corner soon. "The group of lads that I've got - and the one thing I know about Sri Lankan cricket - is that they are great triers. They are great workers. There are a couple of guys putting their hands up and saying, "I'll do that job". With that sort of attitude I'm sure we can make something happen," he said.  While Ford is confident, the defending champions have been found wanting in all departments of the game.      A pointer towards this was their loss against West Indies on Sunday. The batting lacked punch, there was no teeth in bowling and the fielders were lethargic and sloppy. Thisara Perera with 40 runs and leggie Jeffrey Vandersay (1-13) were the only positives for Sri Lanka from the loss against Darren Sammy and his men.      Angelo Mathews, while assessing the team's performance, said, "It's just that we are doing mistakes here and there which cost us the game.(Against West Indies) the middle-order collapse was (the cause for) the downfall. If we had another 20-25 runs more on that wicket it would have been a different story. We'll work hard on our fielding, because we were sloppy again."      While the results haven't been in their favour, Mathews asserted his team is not short on hard work, but admitted pressure is getting to them.      "I think we've been training so hard on our fielding, our batting and bowling. We've given ourselves the best chance in training, we've worked hard with our fielding, (worked) with the fielding coaches on the techniques, everything. It's just the pressure situations I think. We've seen even the best fielders drop catches. Unfortunately for us, we've been dropping a few in the last couple of games. If you drop a good player and if he's going to score runs we'll obviously end up losing."
