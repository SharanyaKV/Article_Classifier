Arsenal star Mesut Ozil didn’t receive a single vote for FWA Footballer of the Year 2016

While Leicester’s Jamie Vardy was crowned as Football Writers’ Association (FWA) 
Footballer of the Year
, Mesut Ozil was, well, completely snubbed.

The Arsenal man has enjoyed an impressive season despite the Gunners failing to mount a serious title challenge and has provided a stunning 18 assists.

He was named as one of six PFA Player of the Year award candidates before losing to Riyad Mahrez but he was totally overlooked by the FWA.

While you would have expected Ozil to have been one of the players who received a vote, the Arsenal man was left off the 12-man list.

Not one single person voted for him.

Seven Leicester players were nominated including N’Golo Kante and the aforementioned Vardy and Mahrez.

Wes Morgan, Kasper Schmeichel, Danny Drinkwater and Danny Simpson also received a portion of the votes.

Tottenham duo Harry Kane and Dele Alli made the cut, while Manchester City pair Sergio Aguero and Kevin De Bruyne were nominated along with West Ham’s Dmitri Payet.

No Arsenal, Manchester United, Chelsea or Liverpool players received votes.
