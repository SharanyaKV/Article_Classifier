Liverpool legend Jamie Redknapp slams Arsenal fans’ teenage break-up with Arsene Wenger

Liverpool legend Jamie Redknapp has criticised Arsenal fans, claiming that they are going through a ‘teenage break-up’ with manager Arsene Wenger.

A section of Gunners supporters 
protested
 the Frenchman’s reign during their 1-0 victory over Norwich City, but others in the stadium sang in support of the under fire boss.

The north Londoners have witnessed their season falling apart since January, with the team crashing out of the Champions League, FA Cup, and Premier League title race.

‘I’ve covered the last three Arsenal matches and seeing their fans right now is like watching a teenage break-up,’ wrote Redknapp in the 
Daily Mail
.

‘Some want a clean break from Arsene Wenger but there’s still a lot of love there and most of them are willing to give it one more try.

‘Wenger is saying nothing to suggest he will walk away and the club are not going to get rid of him.

‘The demonstration was a waste of time but with Wenger the more people tell him to do something, the more resistant he becomes, particularly with transfers.’
