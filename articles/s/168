Tottenham have been handed a boost by news that their in-demand goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has reportedly agreed to stay at the club.

Spurs’ title hopes were dealt a massive blow by Monday’s draw against West Brom, furthering the London club’s fears that the French international 
could leave in the summer
.

The shot-stopper had been touted as a possible replacement for David De Gea should the Manchester United manager leave for Real Madrid.

Spurs had even begun searching for a replacement amid interest from clubs including Paris Saint-Germain.

But according to the Mirror, Lloris has reportedly been persuaded to stay after an impressive season for Mauricio Pochettino’s side, which leaves them just five points behind league leaders Leicester.

The club are now believed to have turned their attention to finding a back up for the Frenchman.

The 29-year-old joined Spurs from Lyon in 2012.

He later admitted that he considered leaving White Hart Lane at the end of 2013/14 season when he played under both Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood.

But after the arrival of Pochettino he signed a contract which keeps him at the club until 2019.
