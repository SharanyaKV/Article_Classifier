Dana White has revealed that Conor McGregor will fight at UFC 201, 202 or 203.

The Irish UFC fighter was due to fight at UFC 200 but was pulled from the event by the UFC president due to failing to complete media duties.

With the 27-year-old pulled from the event, there was talk that McGregor may not fight again.

But White was quick to play down that talk and insisted that McGregor would be back at one of the events following UFC 200.

‘Conor will fight again,’ he said

‘He’ll fight at UFC 201, 202 or 203, whatever.

‘He will be fighting again.

‘The Conor thing has been crazy.’
