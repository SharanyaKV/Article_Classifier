   Cars and racing have always been considered a male bastion, but now four young women racers are trying to disprove this theory     Ria and Neha Dabas       Age: 22 and 24 respectively;      Ria was Delhi state-level gold medallist in shot-put and javelin throw       'Being mentally strong is the key'          Q Tell us something about racing?   Neha: Speed and the thrill are indeed the two core attractions for any racer. Both Ria and I have a lot of experience driving on the road but the Vento Cup series was our first-ever professional race, and also the first time we were driving a race car on the track. We've had no experience of karting or driving on circuits. Racing is a completely different and new world to us and we are enjoying each moment.We were selected in the final list of 24 drivers from 550 entries (they are the only women in this year's Vento Cup).    Q How did your family support you?    Ria: Both of us have been active in sports. Neha is a national level basketball player, a state level athlete and swimmer. I have been a state level athlete as well. Dad is a former Indian Air Force fighter pilot and mom loves riding superbikes. So speed runs in the family.    Q Is it tough to be a racer?    Neha: Without doubt. Every race car driver needs to be physically fit and mentally strong - I think women are capable of achieving those levels easily. Also, if you're in love with this sport the technical part shouldn't be tough. I've noticed one thing - fitness can never act as a barrier if you work hard on yourself. We are still in the learning phase. All sports are different and require different levels of fitness, endurance, strength etc. I can't really say whether men and women can compete together in all games, but as far as motorsport is concerned, women can give men tough competition.    Q What's the future of racing in India?    Ria: Matters are definitely looking up - this year four girls came on the track and raced neck and neck with the boys in the JK Racing Championship. Hopefully, we will see many more girls in the coming years. All that girls need is support from their families. I know a lot of women drivers who are good but they cannot join the sport because of lack of family backing.    Q What are some of the essential qualities of a racer?    Neha: If one wants to be a motorsport driver they must be mentally strong, have optimum levels of physical fitness, high concentration levels, fast reflexes, no fear of injuries.    Q What's next for you?    Ria: For the moment, we are looking forward to our race on India's finest race track, Buddh International Circuit, in Greater Noida; hopefully we will get some points. We still have six races ahead of us and it's going to be exhilarating. At the same time, we will also continue to ride our superbikes - I was the youngest female superbike rider in India. I got my first bike as a gift from my parents on my 20th birthday. Those days I would ride with a group known as 'born 2 ride'.     Mira Erda      Age: 15      At the All Stars Karting 2012 Invitational Yamaha SL International, Malaysia she was placed 5th.      She stood 5th at the National level in Micro Max category of JK Tyre National Rotax Max Championship 2011 in Hyderabad         'Mean realised I was a stiff competitor'           Q Can you tell us about your journey till now?    I own a racing track at my home in Vadodara. As a kid, I would manouevre large vehicles there with ease. My father was convinced I could compete with the boys at the national level. So when he asked me for my views, I immediately agreed.    Q Do you think it is difficult for women to break into motorsports? No, this is not the case. In fact, this is the only sport where men and women can compete together. The number of Indian women taking up this game is phenomenal.    Q Motorsports requires technical knowhow and rigorous training. Which is tougher to put into practice?    This sport demands a lot of physical activity. Racers need stamina to drive. Fitness is always one of the most important parts in racing. A driver needs to control the car with sheer stamina. Obviously the technical part is also not simple. Any person who wants to become a motorsport driver must have a thorough knowledge of the car he/she is controlling.    Q What was the highest barrier - biggest handicap - in your racing career so far?    In the early stages people were not able to accept a girl in a male dominated sport. The initial years were tough because of this bias. Later, things changed. In the beginning my competitors would 'see' me as a girl during the races. When they realised that I was a stiff competition, they had to give up the notion that I was a fluke. At that point, I was no longer just a girl, but their biggest competitor.    Q Motorsport is one of the few sports where men and women can compete against one another. do you think this practice should be taken up in other sports too?    Absolutely. There should not be any discrimination. As in motorsports, women can prove their mettle in other games too. Sports authorities need to rewrite the rulebook so that men and women can compete with each other.    Q Motorsports appears to be skewed towards men. do you think that will change?    It will change over the years. More and more women around the world have taken up this sport. It will no longer be the sole preserve of men!    Q What are the qualities a motorsport driver needs to possess?    He/she must have a determination to be behind the wheels. Develop your power of concentration so that you can manoeuvre the steering as you wish to see who's behind you and stay ahead as much as possible. Lastly, have a winning attitude.     Sneha Sharma      Age: 23      Sneha finished at the 11th place in the Formula 4 event      'Victories don't teach you, failures do'          Q how did you begin racing?    It all started when I was 15. On weekends I would go to a place where karting was popular among young people. One day, I saw a couple of enthusiasts competing against each other. I wanted to be like them, so I asked one of the mechanics to teach me about cars and racing. My interest grew. Gradually I took part in local events. Most of the time I ended up with a place on the podium. From there, national karting championship teams started noticing my aptitude.    Q How difficult is or for girls to break into motorsports?    It's not easy at all. For one, it's a very expensive sport for racer to take up. Women are not welcome on tracks. I faced a lot of flak in the initial days, but now I have made myself strong. I'm a racing driver like the rest and nothing else matters. If we talk about the difference between men and women on the tracks, yes, men are physically stronger A girl might need to spend more time in the gym to be fit and build stamina. Besides that, nothing separates the two. They drive the same car and can compete against each other on the track with skill.    Q What's the most difficult part for a racer?      I don't come from a racing background. Initially, my family didn't like the idea of me getting into this sport. They would tell me, 'what's the need to develop this dangerous hobby', but over time they have understood my passion. During my karting days, I would take my books to the racing track. Managing studies with racing was tough but my passion kept me going. The biggest obstacle I faced was money. This is a very expensive sport. Initially, I didn't have the right shoes for racing. I would drive with school canvas shoes - they would get wet in the rain and slip on the pedal. But somehow I managed.        Q What are the qualities a motorsport driver should have?        One should be passionate about the sport. Always keep in mind that victories don't teach you much as much as your failures do. To win a race, you must finish it. Even if it means you have fallen at the back, don't give up until you have reached the finish line.
