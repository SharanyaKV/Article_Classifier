Jamie Vardy is quite literally having a party as Leicester stars watch Chelsea v Tottenham

It looks like Leicester City hero Jamie Vardy was quite literally ‘having a party’ as several of his team-mates were spotted pulling into the striker’s his house to watch Chelsea versus Tottenham on Monday night.

The Foxes star, who has been integral to the side’s astonishing success in the Premier League this campaign, appears to be playing host as the likes of Robert Huth, Wes Morgan, Christian Fuchs and Gorkan Inler turned up at his home.

A victory for Guus Hiddink’s side at Stamford Bridge would see Claudio Ranieri’s men crowned champions with two games remaining in the English top division.

However, it looks like Leicester may have to wait for title glory after goals from Harry Kane and Son Heung-min gave Spurs an advantage before the break.


It’s hardly a surprise they’re already in party mode, though…
