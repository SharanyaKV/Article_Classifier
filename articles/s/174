Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell has received a two-week suspension after being cited for a dangerous tackle during Saturday's Champions Cup semi-final against Wasps, European Professional Club Rugby has announced.

Farrell was yellow-carded for the challenge on Dan Robson in the 51st minute of the semi-final, with the shoulder-to-head tackle knocking out the Wasps scrum-half.

Robson could no longer continue following the challenge, and the citing officer, Italian Steffano Maramo, decided the challenge was potential worthy of a red card.

Tournament organisers European Professional Club Rugby said that an independent disciplinary committee heard evidence and submissions from Farrell - who did not accept that he committed an act of foul play - during a hearing in London on Wednesday.

"In upholding the citing complaint, the committee found that Farrell had committed an act of foul play that warranted a red card," EPCR said, in a statement.

Farrell's challenge left Robson dazed.

"It determined that the offence was at the low end of World Rugby's sanctions, and selected two weeks as the appropriate entry point.

"The committee added one week to the sanction as a deterrent in line with World Rugby's memoranda regarding dangerous tackles, and then reduced the sanction by one week due to the player's clean disciplinary record, good character and excellent conduct at the hearing, before imposing a suspension of two weeks."

Farrell, 24, will miss Premiership appointments with Newcastle on Sunday and then Worcester six days later, but he will available for Saracens' Champions Cup final clash against French challengers Racing 92 on May 14.
