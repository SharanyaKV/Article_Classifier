Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was toughest Premier League opponent, says Chelsea’s John Terry

Chelsea captain John Terry has revealed that Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was the toughest Premier League opponent he ever faced.

The Blues defender has come up against numerous top-class attackers over the course of his 18 seasons in the English top division but Henry tops the list.

‘The toughest would be Thierry Henry,’ Terry told Goal.

‘He was special.’

The 35-year-old veteran also stated that Ricardo Carvalho, who he spent six successful seasons with in London, was the greatest player he featured alongside.

Terry said: ‘The best player I played alongside at Chelsea would be Carvalho. For England, it would be Rio Ferdinand.’

Former England skipper looks set to depart from Stamford Bridge at the end of the campaign after he announced Chelsea had not offered him a new deal.

It remains to be seen where Terry plays his football next term, but there will no doubt be many clubs vying for his signature.
