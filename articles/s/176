Rumour: Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud emerges as transfer target for Wolfsburg

Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud has emerged as a target for Wolfsburg ahead of the summer transfer window, according to reports.

Giroud has come under intense scrutiny at the Emirates as a result of his poor form in 2015 and many supporters are now calling for the France international striker to be replaced.

 say Wolfsburg are ready to offer the 29-year-old over £100,000-a-week to sign for them at the end of the season.

The Bundesliga outfit are looking for attacking reinforcements after releasing ex-Gunner Nicklas Bendtner only last week.

It remains to be seen whether Arsene Wenger is willing to cash in on Giroud this summer but a substantial offer may tempt the French manager.
