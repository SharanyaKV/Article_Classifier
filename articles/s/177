  NEW DELHI: India's decision to play on rank turners in World T20 has surprised many of their opponents. While Shahid Afridi said on Saturday that he didn't expect so much turn from the Eden Gardens pitch, England spinner Moeen Ali felt that the hosts would be better off playing on batting wickets.      "The pitches India played on were good for spinners. But I feel, India will be more dangerous if they play on flat pitches," England allrounder Ali said on the team's arrival in the Capital on Monday.      It is the glaring disparity in the nature of the surfaces dished out for the tournament that has kept England guessing. While the Wankhede pitch, where England played two games, has been featherbed, India have played out two low-scoring encounters on pitches which took significant turn. "Yeah, maybe it's strange. But am not sure," the off-spinner observed before declaring, "I haven't enjoyed bowling in Mumbai. It was difficult to attack the batsmen there. Hope fully, the other pitches will offer a bit of turn."      This is Ali's first trip to India. One can't fault him for expecting some bite off the pitches. Even the England team management has made a late change in the squad, bringing in uncapped left-arm spinner Liam Dawson. Post Mumbai, the home work has begun from scratch in the hope of finding the turn against Afghanistan at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday." As a spinner, we just see the conditions and go about it. We are trying to get as much information as possible about the last few games played here," Ali remarked.      The first glimpse of the Kotla track offers some relief for Ali. "This pitch is going to be a little bit different here. It is likely to be a bit slower. Obviously, the runs won't come as quickly as it did in Mumbai," he said, adding that the team management is itching to play a third spinner Dawson. "The guys are talking about playing three spinners. We are a good side. We just won a game so I am not sure what the captain and the coach are thinking about."
