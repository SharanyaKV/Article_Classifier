   BENGALURU: A 12-member Indian team leaves the country to participate in the 26th FIBA Asia Women's Championship 2015 that will be held in Wuhan, China from August 29 to September 5.    The team has a mix of veterans and promising youngsters with Anitha Paul Durai, seven-time Asian Championship player, being the captain. Durai regained match fitness after missing out most of last year due to motherhood.    "I have captained the side in 2005 and then in the 2012 Asian Beach Games where we won gold. This time everyone is junior than me but the positive is that everyone will listen to me. Our goal is to maintain 5th position by beating Thailand," she said.        Other familiar names include Kerala forwards Jeena PS, Poojamol KS, Smruthi Radhakrishnan and Stephy Nixon. Young Maharashtra forward Shireen Limaye marks her comeback from injury and will be expected, along with Paul Durai, to provide much needed playmaking abilities to the side.        Among the talented new faces are 19-year-old point guard Kavita Akula from Chhattisgarh (who has successfully completed the four year scholarship programme at IMG Academy) and 17-year-old Karnataka player Bhandavya HM. The two youngsters have already represented India at the junior age group levels, and will be eager to compete against senior international opponents.        Head Coach Francisco Garcia said she was looking forward to the championship. She trained her wards by playing practice matches against local boys club sides based out of Bengaluru.        Air Asia is sponsoring the Indian team's participation at the event.
