  BENGALURU: What should have been a one-sided affair turned out to be quite a contest as Australia crawled their way to a three-wicket win over fighting Bangladesh in the World T20 match here on Monday.  With the teams desperately needing a win to stay on alive in the tournament, Bangladesh bowlers Mustafizur Rahman (2-30) and Shakib Al Hasan (2-27) came up with timely wickets to derail Australia's chase. But thanks to a splendid 45-ball 58 by opener Usman Khawaja, Australia kept their title aspirations well on track. Khawaja's knock was the key as Australia chased down Bangladesh's total of 156 with nine balls to spare.      Australia set about their chase in a dominating fashion with Khawaja, in the company of Shane Watson, took the attack into the opposition. The southpaw launched Mashrafe Mortaza to long-on the very first ball of the innings and followed it up with two boundaries of Al-Amin Hossain as Australia reached fifty in 5.4 overs. Khawaja's best show was against Shakib Al Hasan - he hit the left-arm spinner for three consecutive boundaries.      When the openers looked settled, Watson ran himself out but not before adding 62 runs for the opening stand. Thereafter six wickets fell in quick succession before James Faulkner and Peter Nevill combined to guide Australia past the target.      Earlier, lusty blows from Mahmudullah (49, 29b, 7x4, 1x6) and his unbroken 51-run association with Rahim (15) helped Bangladesh overcome a wobbly start to make Australia's chase challenging. Bangladesh were struggling at 1055 and with four overs left, but the sixth-wicket duo made a mockery of the Australian bowlers adding 48 runs to lift the team to a decent position.      The 30-year-old right-hand batsman clobbered 18 runs off Faulkner in the 18th over that included four consecutive boundaries. He followed it up with two more hits to the ropes off Shane Watson. In the final over, Mammudullah smashed Nathan Coulter-Nile for two back-to-back boundaries.
