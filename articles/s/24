Nike announces ‘What The’ Mercurial Superfly IV boot and it more than lives up to its name

Nike has announced the new ‘What The Mercurial’ boot is to be released on May 5th – and it certainly grabs your attention.

Hitting shelves just in time for a great summer of football, the model represents a farewell release, combining all 16 previous Mercurial colourways into one super boot.

And it is a super limited edition so chances are it’s going to be expensive (at least once they’ve all sold out).

The Nike design team has certainly paid respect to the range’s history with the release, even referencing the famous green tinged ‘R9’ boots worn by Ronaldo for Brazil during the 1998 World Cup.

We thought it was a joke or a scam when we first heard it but no, here it is 
on the official Nike website

It is the first football boot to get the ‘What The’ unifying treatment, and looks like a cross between David Seaman’s 1996 England goalkeeping kit and something from an Acid House rave.

Grabbing a piece of what the sportswear giant describe as ‘iconic style’ will set you back a hefty $300 (£205).

But if the boots still leave you wanting to kick it, you need to be on the ball, as only 3,000 are presently planned for release worldwide.
