  Regardless of the fact that India is out of the World Cup, India's World T20 campaign has been a Virat Kohli show. Even as India lost the semi-final to the West Indies, Virat's performances earned him laurels from pundits and fans alike. While Virat fever gripped India, one neighbourhood in West Delhi has a more personal interest in the Indian vice-captain's performance. Meera Bagh, where Virat grew up and learnt to play cricket the way he does, turns into 'Virat Vihar' every time India plays.   'Woh ab India ka Virat hai'   As we take an auto from the Janakpuri East Metro station to Meera Bagh on the evening of the semi-final, we ask the autowallah if he knows that Virat Kohli used to stay here once. He replies, "Humein nahi pata tha ki woh yahin rehte thay. Lekin bahut achha laga sunke ki woh yahaan ke rehne waale hain. Virender Sehwag bhi toh yahin paas ke Na jafgarh ilake ke hain. Virat ke liye toh kya hi bolein. Ab woh sirf Meera Bagh ke Vi rat thodi na hain, poore desh ke Virat hain."   Crowd outside the Kohli house at 'Virat Vihar'   The Kohlis used to live at A-43, Meera Bagh, before moving to Gurgaon last July. Even though the family doesn't live there anymore, the house still bears the Kohli nameplate and neighbours say that Virat's brother and mother visit the house every now and then. The house, something of a landmark in the locality, still manages to draw a few curious 'tourists', particularly on days when India is playing. Most people in Meera Bagh have a Virat anecdote to share. A guard at the A-block en trance tells us, "Pehle toh bahut log aate thay poochne ki Virat Kohli ka ghar kaunsa hai. Ab unke jaane ke baad thoda kam hua hai, par phir bhi match ke time ek-do log aaj bhi aa jaate hain." A crowd of 10-12 youngsters had gathered outside A-43 as India's innings gathered pace on the day of the semifinal and Virat started to hit those boundaries. Pankaj, the guard at Virat's building, says that the crowd used to be much bigger when the family stayed there. "Ab toh ginti ke hi log hain. Pehle toh itne aate thay ki dhakka maar ke hatana padta tha. Har match ke time yahan 50-100 logon ki bheed jama ho jaati thi," he says. Listening to the match score on a pocket radio, he adds, "Yeh colony toh famous hi Virat Kohli ki wajah se hai, sab 'Virat Vihar' bolte hain."      Residents recall that after the 2011 World Cup victory, there was a sea of people outside the house to congratulate the family. Kuldeep Malik, a resident, says, "When India won the 2011 World Cup, there was a loudspeaker blaring from Virat's house about the win and there was a huge crowd outside his residence. The RWA had put up a big screen in the park also."        'Haar-jeet nahi, humko Virat ki batting se matlab hai'     As India ended its innings, there were fireworks all around Meera Bagh. For the residents, it was more of a celebration of Virat's innings than India's score. "Humko haarjeet se matlab nahi. Apna Kohli achha khela hai, wahi kaafi hai," a boy standing outside Virat's residence says. Rahul Sharma, a driver standing nearby, adds, "Woh WhatsApp forward toh dekha hi hai na? Poore team ko Baahubali ki tarah utha rakha hai Virat ne. Hum ko uski batting se matlab hai bas." AK Bedi, a neighbour, says, "When the family was here, there was a buzz when he used to return after playing some series. Even Anushka (Sharma) visited the house a few times, the next door neighbours tell us." Sunita Bedi, his wife, adds, "Inna sona khela Virat ne. Aur log bhi utna achha khel lete toh jeet jaate."      Even though India lost the match, for the residents of Meera Bagh, Virat was still the star. Sahiba Juneja, a university student who stays on the second floor of A-43, says, "I met him three years back.We hadn't moved here yet, but I had come to see our house. When my friends got to know that I stay in the same build ing as Virat, they were like, 'Please milwa do. Please get us his autograph.' Now all the hoopla has reduced and the autograph re quests have also stopped ever since the family moved to Gurgaon."
