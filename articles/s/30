There’s been plenty of talk as to whether Manchester United star Bastian Schweinsteiger will go to Euro 2016 with Germany.

The former Bayern Munich man has suffered with injury throughout the season and has failed to make a real impact in the Premier League.

Some have suggested that Schweinsteiger could go to the tournament in a similar role to how David Beckham went with England in a supportive capacity when he was injured.

But Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil says that they need the 31-year-old far more on the pitch than they do off it.

‘Bastian Schweinsteigher is a footballer, not a mascot,’ 
he told Goal.


‘We also do not need him as a third assistant coach.

‘We need him and his experience and game intelligence on the pitch.’
