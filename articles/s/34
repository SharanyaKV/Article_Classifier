  MUMBAI: Experienced South Africa all-rounder Jean Paul Duminy doesn't think there is any additional pressure on him and his team mates going into the ICC World Twenty20 Championships because the Proteas have invariably come unstuck in these major events.  "Pressure is always there but there's no additional pressure. In the past I would like to think that we had buckled under pressure. But in the last T20 and 50-over World Cups we lost in the semi-finals, yes, but were outplayed by better teams," said Duminy at a media interactive session here on Friday.  "We have made big strides. We have competed in those semi-finals and given ourselves a good chance of winning, but unfortunately not got over the line. Hopefully, this time around if we get that opportunity again we would come out on the better side," said the 31-year old batsman who bowls off spin.      Duminy was of the opinion that teams ranked in the top four (South Africa are No.1) going into these world events are at an advantageous position.      He also said that the proliferation of T20 leagues around the world has made this prestigious tournament a more even field.      "So many T20 cricket is being played around the world that guys are getting more experienced, especially when it comes to the shorter format. Many sides are capable and it makes it more exciting. Not one side can potentially win the series or tournament.      "If you are ranked in the top 3 or 4 you give yourselves a good chance coming into this sort of tournament. We are quietly confident that we stand a good chance," he added.
