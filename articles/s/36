For the second Champions League gameweek running Zinedine Zidane was left with a sizeable hole in his slacks after Real Madrid's 0-0 draw with Manchester City in Tuesday's Champions league semi-final first leg.

Unable to name the injured Cristiano Ronaldo on his team-sheet and forced to haul off Karim Benzema at the break, Zidane will be forgiven for again straining the seams on his bottoms after leaving Manchester unscathed; The tie now heads to a straight shootout at the Bernabeu for a place in May's San Siro final. 

The former France international earlier this month first showed the world a glimpse of his underwear as he watched his side overturn a 2-0 first leg deficit to advance past Wolfsburg 3-2 on aggregate in the quarter-final. And now - after an upturn in domestic form - Real are dreaming of an 11th Champions League crown just weeks into Zidane's reign

The 43-year-old has seen has seen his side claw back ground in the Spanish title race since his appointment on January 4, while Los Blancos overcame Barcelona in his first taste of El Clasico from the dugout earlier this month. 

But the prospect of silverware, which seemed a distant dream when Rafael Benitez was sacked by Bernabeu chiefs at the beginning of the New Year, will have Zidane searching for a new outfitter.

At least the Real Madrid boss can see the funny side. Watch him point out the tearing trouser trend in the clip below.
