Former
 Arsenal
 and 
Chelsea
 full-back 
Ashley Cole
 was sent off for two bookable offences within 32 seconds in LA Galaxy's 1-1 draw with Kansas City on Sunday.

The 35-year-old was shown a yellow card for a a studs-up challenge on Benny Feilhaber just moments after being cautioned for time-wasting as he delayed a throw-in. 

Giovani dos Santos had earlier marked his inclusion in Mexico's preliminary squad for the 2016 Copa America Centenario by scoring the equaliser.

Brad Davis put Kansas City ahead in the 30th minute before Gyasi Zardes sent dos Santos in on goal three minutes before the break and the Mexican finished with a delightful chip over goalkeeper Tim Melia.

But the visitors were forced to settle for a point after playing the final 20 minutes with 10 men.
