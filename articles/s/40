Piers Morgan compares Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un


Arsenal super-fan Piers Morgan has compared Arsene Wenger to the supreme leader of North Korea Kim Jong-un in his latest social media attack on the French boss.


Television personality Morgan, a well-known Gooner and Arsenal shareholder, has long been a critic of Wenger and has called for his sacking on countless occasions in recent memory.

But his latest assault on Twitter may be his most savage yet, criticising fellow supporters for cheering the Gunners manager in their 1-0 victory over Norwich at the weekend.

‘Congrats again to all Arsenal fans who cheered/chanted Wenger into another £25m 3-year contract on Saturday,’ Wenger tweeted alongside a photograph of notorious dictator Kim Jong-un.

Fans had planned a widespread protest at the Emirates for the fixture – and many were seen holding up ‘time for change’ signs during the match.

While a large proportion of fans in the stadium did not take part in the protest, Morgan is clearly sticking to his guns…

North Koreans chant 'There's Only One Kim Jong-un' when he passes in the street.
It's not a sign of support.
