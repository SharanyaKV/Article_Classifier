When are the Championship play-offs 2016? Dates, times, TV schedule, prediction and odds

The 
Championship
 season is reaching its conclusion as the race for the 
Premier League
 goes right down to the wire.

And the excitement will only build once 46 games have been completed and we know who will be competing in the Championship play-offs for a place in the top tier. 

Sheffield Wednesday (6th) made sure of their spot in the post-season lottery with victory over Cardiff on Saturday, while Derby County (5th) and Hull (4th) will also be dreaming of Wembley. 

One of Middlesbrough and Brighton, who face eachother on the final day, will have to settle for a play-off spot, while the other will join already promoted Burnley in the top flight. 

But what is there to know ahead of the semis?
