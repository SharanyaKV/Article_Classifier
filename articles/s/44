Cristiano Ronaldo
 manages to snatch the headlines even when he fails to make it onto the pitch. 

The 32-year-old missed Real Madrid's 3-2 La Liga victory over Rayo Vallecano at the weekend and didn't recover in time to feature in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final at Manchester City.

The Ballon d'Or runner-up gave a thumbs down to the Real fans who had arrived in Manchester early on Tuesday evening as he took to the Etihad Stadiumpitch in cardigan and tie ahead of the European last-four clash.

It was the first suggestion that Ronaldo might not feature despite assurances in recent days from manager Zinedine Zidane that the forward would recover.

“If it was a final, I would have played," Ronaldo reportedly told Spanish radio after the teamsheet confirmed Real fears, insisting the decision to leave him on the sidelines was merely precautionary. 


Does this mean Ronaldo will not start for Real Madrid?

So, how better to fill your time while your team-mates play out a goalless draw and edge closer to May's Milan final? Listen to your favourite artist, send a few texts; heck, why not watch the game?. 

Not Ronaldo. Indeed, the Portugal international was snapped watching a clip on Gary Lineker's Instagram feed of himself gesturing to the travelling supporters upon arrival. 

At least it'll keep his eyes off La Liga's scoring charts.
