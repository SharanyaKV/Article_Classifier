For all those who say WWE is fake, this looked very, very painful.

Enzo Amore was knocked out after falling from the ring during a fight between him and Big Cass against the Vaudevillains.

After knocking his head against one of the ropes, Amore, real name Eric Arndt, smashed down against the mat and was clearly unconscious when hitting the ground.

Although the bout was ended, the event continued as Amore was taken to hospital.

Luckily for the wrestler he wasn’t severely hurt, and was diagnosed with concussion before being released from hospital.

INJURY UPDATE: 
@WWEAaLLday21
 has been discharged from a local medical facility, diagnosed with a concussion. All other testing negative.
