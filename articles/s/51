Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was the toughest Premier League opponent, says John Terry


Chelsea
 captain John Terry says former 
Arsenal 
striker 
Thierry Henry
 is the toughest 
Premier League 
opponent he has faced.

Terry, whose future at Stamford Bridge remains uncertain, has been with the Blues since the age of 14 and graduated through the club's youth system before going on to make 481 top flight appearances. 

The 35-year-old has thwarted many of the world's leading strikers en route to three Premier League titles, but says Henry - who scored 10 goals against Chelsea while with Arsenal - was the hardest to marshal. 

"The toughest would be Thierry Henry," Terry told Goal. "He was special."

Terry's Chelsea deal is due to expire this summer and a change in management at the club has put his future in doubt. 

The former England captain said earlier this year the club had opted against renewing his deal, but the final decision will lie with incoming boss Antonio Conte. 

Terry has won 14 major trophies since turning professional 16 years ago and appeared in reflective mood as he also named the best Blues player he has featured alongside. 

The Chelsea captain added: "The best player I played alongside at Chelsea would be Ricardo Carvalho. For England, it would be Rio Ferdinand."
