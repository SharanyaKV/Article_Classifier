Liverpool tell Paris Saint-Germain Jurgen Klopp wants Javier Pastore transfer

Liverpool are pushing to seal the transfer of Paris Saint-Germain star Javier Pastore, reports in France say.

Chief scout Kevin Hunt has told the Parisians of Jurgen Kloppâ€™s interest in the Argentina international.

And they are hopeful of signing the quality midfielder in the summer, 
according to France Football.


Pastore has struggled with injury this season and has often found himself out of favour under current coach Laurent Blanc.

PSG have a wealth of attacking options at their disposal and the likes of Angel Di Maria and Lucas Moura are often preferred in attacking midfield roles.

The 27-year-old is thought to be concerned about his future and the former Palermo star is eyeing up a move.

Liverpool are keen to sign him but will face competition across Europe including from Serie A champions Juventus.
