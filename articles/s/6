Chelsea vs Tottenham: John Obi Mikel hints Blues won&apos;t do Leicester City any title favours


John Obi Mikel
 has hinted 
Chelsea
 will not do 
Leicester City
 any favours by beating 
Tottenham
 tonight, saying the Foxes must win the Premier League title - and not be handed it.


Chelsea host Spurs
 at Stamford Bridge on Monday night knowing that should they beat or draw with Mauricio Pochettino's title chasers, Leicester will be crowned champions as they currently sit eight points clear at the top of the table.

Chelsea pair Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas recently admitted they do not want to see Tottenham take the Blues' title from them this season, preferring Leicester to win instead.

But ahead of the London derby, Mikel has insisted Chelsea will play their own game against Spurs to show their fans they remain as motivated as ever - and not because they would prefer Leicester to win the Premier League over Tottenham.

"We’re as motivated as ever, we’re looking forward to the game. They have to win, we need to win," Mikel told Sky Sports.

"We want to use this game to make a statement to our fans. We’re dedicated, motivated and we know what it means to be here.

"We’ll play the same way tonight as we will against Leicester. You have to win the Premier League, you don’t get given it."
