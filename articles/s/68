Manchester United have handed a trial to Keith Groeneveld and the young defender has uploaded pictures of his first day at Carrington.

The 16-year-old South African has been flown in from Belgian outfit KV Mechelen and is spending the week with the Red Devils before returning to his parent club.

Groeneveld, who trained with United a few years back when he was at Antwerp, took to Instagram to post photographs of him looking proud in United’s training kit.

The teenager will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of compatriot Adnan Januzaj who completed a move to Old Trafford after impressing back in 2011.

It remains to be seen whether the Premier League side will hand Groeneveld further opportunities to show his worth in their colours.
