   WROCLAW (Poland): India's compound archer Abhishek Verma will look to avenge his Asian Games gold medal loss when he clash with Esameli Ebadi of Iran at the Archery World Cup Stage 3 here tomorrow.    Verma had to settle for a silver after losing the men's compound archery individual final of 2014 Incheon Asian Games against Ebadi.      "My rank may be low but I'm taking on experienced archers with confidence. I've realised that the key to success it to remain happy. A perfect score will come automatically if you're happy. And I'm looking forward to the match tomorrow," the world no. 18 said.        Verma said his motto would be to not think about the rival archer.        "If I think about the other archer, I lose," Verma said. "If I win, I'll be grinning."
