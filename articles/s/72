Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink was knocked over in a violent melee at the end of a 2-2 draw with Tottenham at Stamford Bridge.


Several staff and players could be seen coming together after the final whistle as both sides headed down the tunnel and, at one point, Hiddink fell to the floor which is clearly visible in the short clip.

The result means Leicester City are crowned 2015/16 Premier League champions, after odds of 5000-1 of them achieving such a feat at the start of the season.

Second-half goals from Gary Cahill and Eden Hazard canceled out Harry Kane and Son Heung-min’s efforts which put Spurs 2-0 up before the break.

But what on earth was going on after the match…?
