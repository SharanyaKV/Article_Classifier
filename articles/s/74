  NAGPUR: The  Badminton Asia Championships  provide yet another opportunity for the top  Indian shuttlers  to arrest the recent slide and make a solid impact as the battle begins at the  Wuhan Sports Center  on Tuesday.  The week-long annual competition will feature the best shuttlers from the Asian countries. Most of them are keen to shine with an eye on the Rio Olympics.  India's hopes rest on singles rather than doubles.  Saina Nehwal ,  PV Sindhu  and Kidambi Srikanth are determined to stop the late poor run to boost their rankings ahead of the mega event in August.  Saina will begin her campaign against the Group A qualifying winner. The fifth seed Indian is expected to win her initial couple of rounds but likely to face her nemesis Wang Shixian in the quarterfinals. The Chinese is leading the long rivalry 7-6. The road for Saina gets tougher from quarters as even if she gets the better of Shixian, she might run into another Wang - Wang Yihan, sixth seed, or second seed Nozomi Okuhara in the semis.  Saina's coach Vimal Kumar is expecting a much-improved performance from her ward. "It is a good draw for her. She should be doing well in China," said Vimal.  Sindhu will take on Maria Febe Kusumastuti of Indonesia in the first round. Sindhu, who is in the top half of the draw, has a good record against world No. 23 Kusumastuti and beaten her rival thrice in succession after losing their first encounter way back in 2009. The 21-year-old Hyderabadi will certainly like to make an impact following an average season so far.  Srikanth will square off against Lee Dong Keun of Korea. It will be their maiden fight on the circuit. The eighth seed Srikanth had suffered several first-round exits in 2016 so he will be wary when he face world No. 19 Lee on Wednesday. The draw is tough for Srikanth, who has slipped to world No. 13 now. He will have to rise to the occasion to make inroads in the competition.  India have four pairs in the doubles including two in the men's doubles but all have difficult draw and unlikely to progress beyond first two rounds.  Jwala Gutta  and  Ashwini Ponnappa  need to raise the bar as they are facing world No. 8 pair Chang Ye Na and Lee So Hee of Korea in the opener.     Indian squad Women's singles:   Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu.       Men's singles:   K Srikanth .       Men's doubles:  Manu Attri-B Sumeeth Reddy; Pranaav Chopra-Akshay Dewalkar.
