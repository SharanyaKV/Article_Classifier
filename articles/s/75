  MUMBAI: By virtue of being the defending champions, Sri Lanka should have entered this World Twenty20 with a bit of hype, hoopla and confidence in their stride. However, so badly have their fortunes dipped since that memorable evening in Dhaka two years ago, when they clinched this title for the first time, that the Lankans are actually sneaking in quietly, quite like the also-rans.    The reason for the slide is simple: Sri Lanka just haven't been able to find replacements -in terms of both leadership and skill -for legends Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Before arriving here, the islanders put up a pathetic display at the Asia Cup T20 -losing to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to crash out on a miserable note.      What has made things worse is the knee injury to their biggest trump card, Lasith Malinga, without whom their attack looks toothless. The ace pacer wasn't able to play a single game after he was named the T20 captain, and wisely chose to pass on the baton to Angelo Mathews, who anyways leads Lanka in Tests and ODIs, and was at the helm in the Asia Cup.This change in captaincy , and the selection panel, took place days before the World Twenty20, hurting the build-up to the tourna ment severely .      Mathews, though, says this imperfect backdrop wouldn't really affect his team's performance on the big stage. The all-rounder is desperately hoping that Malinga runs in to bowl the first delivery for them once the World Cup gets underway . "It's unfortunate that Malinga is not fit yet, so he had to take that call.But he's a very important person in our team so we kept him in the squad hoping he'll be able to play the first game. .After he resigned as captain, Sri Lanka Cricket asked me to take over. We are not very disturbed, because the administrators know what needs to be done ," he summed up.      It's never easy to take this kind of a responsibility at the last minute, and the 28-year-old confessed that he wasn't prepared to take up the World T20 captaincy on such a short notice. "I wasn't (ready). But I have the experience of captaining for quite a few years now, so it's a challenge. Whether you are the captain or not, you have a certain role to play in the team," Mathews said.
