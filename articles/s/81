Chelsea v Tottenham Hotspur: Stats show Christian Eriksen is actually better than Willian

Chelsea have endured a torrid campaign this season –  sacking Jose Mourinho, crashing out of Europe, and languishing far from a Champions League spot – but one bright spark has been the improved form of Brazil playmaker Willian.

Or so it seemed.

Statistics released by Oulala Fantasy Football from number crunching experts Opta, actually reveal a very different picture, suggesting Tottenham’s Christian Eriksen has enjoyed the more productive season.

Willian has made 31 Premier League appearances this season, only one less than Eriksen, but has delivered a lower pass success rate per game (36 to 41) and created fewer chances per game (2.4. to 3.3) than the Danish attacker.

Most strikingly of all, Willian’s five goals and five assists are vastly trumped by Eriksen’s six goals and 12 assists.

However, it should be said that the Blues’ Willian shows merit in other ways, with a higher pass completion rate per game (84% to 81%) and more successful ‘take-ons’  (2.5 compared to Eriksen’s 1).

The Brazilian also saved some of his best form this season for the club’s Champions League run, scoring five goals in eight games.

But as for tonight’s game, the statistics leave no doubt that Eriksen is the key danger man out of the pair.

And Tottenham will need him at his best if they are to get the win they need to keep the Premier League title race alive.

This will be a tough task considering Spurs have not won in 23 attempts at Stamford Bridge.
