   NEW DELHI: In a heartwarming gesture, Basketball Federation of India President K Govindaraj has pledged monetary support Satnam Singh's family, with a monthly stipend of Rupees 50,000.    The 19-year-old Satnam made history earlier this year by becoming the first Indian national to be drafted as a player in the National Basketball Association (NBA).    Govindaraj made this announcement during a meeting with Satnam at an event organised by NBA India here.    Explaining the reasoning behind this decision, Govindaraj said, "By overcoming numerous obstacles, Satnam has immensely contributed in putting Indian basketball on the world map, and continues to bring positive attention to the sport within India. Even though he is still very young, he has already shown himself to be a capable role model for other Indian youth to aspire and realise their full potential."      Satnam's story is a remarkable fairytale of grit, hope, courage and maximisation of innate attributes through proper training and timely exposure. The son of a farmer, Satnam grew up in the tiny village of Ballo Ke in Punjab. By the age of 9, he was already 6ft tall, and at the advice of an uncle, he was sent to Ludhiana Basketball Academy to hone his talent.        At the age of 14, he was awarded a four year scholarship to train in the USA. He kept making rapid strides, while parallely returning to India during his breaks to represent his home state of Punjab in the national championships.        He has also represented the Indian junior and senior national teams in the past. In this regard, he clarified his earlier comments on his availability to play for the country.        Satnam informed, and the NBA confirmed, that while his focus is on representing his team Dallas Mavericks and its Developmental League affiliate Texas Legends, with enough advance notice he will be privileged to don national colours as long as it doesn't conflict with his NBA commitments.
