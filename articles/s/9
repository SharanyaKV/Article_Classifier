  VIZIANAGARAM: Cheteshwar Pujara has been more of a perfectionist. Before every ball he faces, he makes it a point to check his grip and field placings. It has helped him so far in his career. After a lean patch during England and Australia tour in 2014, Pujara has bounced back strongly and played a major role in team India's twin Test series victory against Sri Lanka and South Africa. Pujara is now eying the Ranji Trophy title and a place in shorter formats in the national team. He has been working hard on various aspects of his game.  Pujara spoke to TOI on various aspects.    Excerpts from an interview    Q: Is it difficult to digest when people say you can't play shorter formats...   A: I think it's people's perception that I can't play the shorter formats. They start assuming things because I haven't played that many games for India in shorter formats. You can't say that I can't. I have just played three or four ODIs. If you look at other players, they have got more opportunities. It's a matter of time. With more runs in domestic format this season and possibly in the IPL, you never know things can change. I have spoken to big players Rahul (Dravid) Bhai and Sachin (Tendulkar) Paaji and they also told me that there's nothing wrong with my technique. They also believe that I can play the other formats of the game. I am working on few other shots which have already given me the results in domestic T20. Going ahead, if I have more shots it will be an advantage.   Q: Can you elaborate what kind of shots?   A: I don't want to disclose the shots because I don't want bowlers to have an idea about them. If I keep on working on different shots, it will create doubts in bowlers' mind. Look at AB De Villiers, he hits every shot from sweep to paddle sweep to reverse sweep to fast bowlers so the bowlers aren't sure what's coming their way.         Dravid and Pujara during a practice session. (TOI Photo)    Q: Your teammates Virat, Rohit and Ajinkya are playing orthodox shots even in Twenty20. Does it give you confidence that if they can do it, I can also do the same?   A; Definitely. If you look at the ODI format, you don't need to accelerate as much as in T20. You can still take your time and once you are set you can play your shots. If you look at my Test innings, lots of the time I start slowly because you need to get set but once I am set I always accelerate and the strike rate is always on the higher side.  Overall, in my Test innings the strike rate is always 55-60, which is really good for a normal batsman. If you compare my strike rate with any other batsman at the international level, it's better or at par. I don't want to compare myself with Virender Sehwag or Chris Gayle or AB De Villiers. They are in a different league. But if you compare with other batsmen like Kane Williamson, Joe Root, who are progressing or somebody like Virat, the strike rate is quite similar. At the end of the day, it's not all about strike rate in the Test format, it's about how you have contributed to the team's success and how you are willing to improve. At the international level, it's about improving all the time because at the level you face the different conditions and different challenges. As long as I am progressing, I am really happy.   Q: Did you speak to Virender Sehwag about the approach in T20 when you shared dressing room with him in Kings XI Punjab set-up?   A: Yes I did and he told me that you have all the shots in the book. It's all about expressing yourself in the middle and be fearless. He told me to work on few areas and that's what I'm doing in One-dayers and Twenty20.   Q: You looked aggressive in Test series against South Africa. Was that a conscious effort?   It comes naturally. You assess the situation. Sometimes you look to target a particular bowler where you can feel you can accelerate and put pressure on the opposition and score around 100 runs in a session. You analyse the situation and plan accordingly.    Q: How difficult was your comeback against Sri Lanka?   A: Comebacks are always difficult because there are so many things going on in your mind. Sometimes you feel you might not get another opportunity but when I was making my comeback I thought that the amount of runs I have made at the domestic level and even at the international level...I had more than 2000 runs under my belt. I felt that I needed to stay focussed and keep working on my game, keep improving the areas I needed to work on. When I went into bat in my comeback game I never thought about anything else. I just wanted to watch the ball and play according to the merit of the ball. Every cricketer goes through a phase they don't perform as they should have. The kind of starts I have got at the international level, the expectations were really high because I have scored double hundreds. Whenever I scored hundred those were big scores. So when I was scoring 70s and 80s, nobody was noticing that. That is the past now. I am batting well. I am back in form. I am looking good in the nets. I did well even in domestic T20s. Overall whatever areas I have worked on, it has come out well. I think I am capable of playing ODIs and T20 formats as well. I have worked on those aspects and it has paid off. Somebody was telling me I was fourth or fifth in the run-getters list in T20s.    Q: How much that century was a relief for you?   A: Somewhere down the line I knew I was capable of scoring runs at the international level and it can be each and every inning. Most of the time, the way I have approached my domestic cricket, every second or third innings, I have scored a hundred. So I believe, I could do the same at the international level. So when I scored hundred I was happy. I won't say I was relieved because at the international level you always want to keep improving because you can't be relaxed that I have scored hundred...I have secured my place. It's not about securing your place. It's always about contributing to the team's success. I bat at No.3 and it's lot of responsibility batting at that position. I need to make sure that team doesn't lose too many wickets early on and If I can get the partnership with another opener, then we have chance of scoring 350-400 runs and if you do that most of the time you wouldn't end up losing the game.   Q: What kind of mindset is required when you are playing on those challenging wickets?       A: When you play on such wickets you have to be positive. You have to accept that I got a good ball and I couldn't do much about it but you focus in the next innings, focus on the game, especially in the Test matches. If I haven't scored in the first innings, I still have a chance to make amends in the second. The kind of innings I played in Mohali, it was very crucial for us. You have to focus on each and every ball if you are playing on challenging wickets because you can't be relaxed that I am set now. If you are playing on challenging wicket an odd ball can turn or straighten and you end up getting out. So the concentration and focus is required on such wickets.       Pressure is always something people talk. How important is to handle it and did you talk to Rahul Dravid on this issue?       I had a chat with him during India 'A' series. First of all he told me that there's nothing wrong with my technique, which was a big relief mentally. He has been watching me since I made my Under-19 debut and when I was playing Ranji match against Karnataka. So he knew I am capable of scoring good runs. His advice was really crucial. You have to be really tough mentally at the international level. When you play at that level, there will be sledging and other things. There will be pressure on you by media or people. They want team to win each and every game, which is not very easy. So you still have to accept because there are a lot of emotions attached to it. I look at it in a positive way. When you win, it makes people happy. Recently, when I was travelling and India were playing last Twenty20 match in Australia, the people were glued to TV sets not realising they have a flight to catch. So we have a role to play and that part comes when you are strong mentally.
