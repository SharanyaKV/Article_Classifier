Louis van Gaal's side have reportedly made the 18-year-old midfielder one of their priority targets going int the summer market.

United's scouts are said to have watched Sanches all season, in which he's scored two goals in 31 appearances for Benfica in his breakthrough campaign.

And according to transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio, the United board - led by former manager and current director Sir Alex Ferguson - have given the green light for the move.

United have reportedly agreed a £47.4million deal to land Sanches, with Benfica demanding an upfront payment of £31.5m and add-ons worth £15.9m.

But Di Marzio claims United are keen to spread the cost of the transfer in instalments over four years.

Sanches' form for the Primeira Liga side earned him a his first two caps for Portugal last month after making 40 appearances for the youth sides.
