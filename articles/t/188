  CHENNAI: Malaria seems to strike migrant youngsters more than it seems to strike other groups in society in India, according to a recent survey based on claims data at SBI General Insurance Co.    As many as 52% of malaria claims handled by the insurer were from people within 16-35 years of age and only 28% of claims were from people between 36-50 years of age.    Malaria seems to be more prevalent among people who work, study away from home, according to the study.    The highest number of claims were received from Gujarat at 32%, followed by Maharashtra at 21%, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, said the study, which analysed 34,482 internal claims data for five years to discover trends among different age groups and genders for claims made against malaria.    In the last two years, the monsoon months of September and October saw the highest number of claims being received, said the study released on the occasion of the World Malaria Day (April 25).      India was working and making progress towards the elimination of malaria, said the study, which said it had seen a dip in the frequency of malaria claims to 1% in FY15-16 from 2% in FY14-15 from 3% in FY 13-14.        On an average, malaria claims did not account for more than 2% of total settled claims - in line with the trend in India, which saw a fall in malaria cases to 8.82 lakhs in 2013 from 20 lakh in 2000. Of the total claims received for certain infectious and parasitic diseases, 9% claims had been received for malaria, added SBI General Insurance.        While malaria can be caused by different species of plasmodium like falciparum, malariae, ovale and vivax, the study found that as many as 53.59% cases reported were vivax malaria and about 32.34% cases were falciparum malaria.        According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) in India, around 1.5 million confirmed cases are reported annually of which 40%-50% are due to plasmodium falciparum. Cerebral complications from malaria, which causes fits, swelling in the brain, sometimes leading to permanent brain damage, were reported only in 0.30% cases.
