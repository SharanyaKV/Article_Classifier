  NEW DELHI: While apps can make the most difficult of tasks a cakewalk, some apps can also come with malicious content. If one isn't wary of this, these apps can cause serious damage to your smartphones.  We too came across one such  app  today, courtesy a flyer we got with our newspaper. Called 'I'm Here', the  app  seemed quite useful from all the information given about it in the flyer.    The way it was described, the app appears to be a wonder. It promises 24x7 real-time tracking of users' cars, bikes; safety alerts and more.   In a nutshell, the flyer made the  app   sound like a solution to a lot of our problems. If you are thinking it is too good to be true, you are right.        New app stores driving licence, other vehicle-related documents   RTA m-Wallet helps motorists avoid physically carrying documents like driving licence, registration certification and other vehicle related papers.
​       To test the app, we decided to download it. However, we couldn't find it on   Google Play Store  . So the next step was an obvious one.    We went to the website mentioned in the flyer - www.ihere24x7.com - and looked for the app's download link there.      However, when we clicked on the link, it did not direct us to the Play Store -- like it should have. It instead downloaded a file on our device. When we tried opening the file, it didn't open (luckily) and we got a message on our  phone   which read:      "For security, your phone is set to block installation of apps obtained from unknown sources."      Mobile app launched to track vehicles   Ideal Insurance Brokers Pvt Ltd has launched a mobile app to track commercial vehicle fleets -- trucks, buses, taxis and school vans.                  So, in case you too come across the 'I'm here'  app   or an advertisement of this app please avoid it. This app may harm your  smartphone  and  tablet . For, as they say: What seems too good to be true, sometimes is too good to be true.
