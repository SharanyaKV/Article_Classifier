  The modern-day world needs many essential resources in order to keep working smoothly, and  energy  is probably one of the most important of those. From household appliances to rapid-transit systems to big corporations, just about everything depends on one or the other type of energy.  According to ExxonMobil's Energy Outlook, the global energy demand is expected to increase about 25% in the 2014-2040 time-frame. This is largely because of factors like population and economic growth, and rapidly depleting non-renewable resources (e.g.  petroleum ) aren't going to last forever. So the only way is to shift focus towards renewable  energy resources .        Rs 4.34 a unit: Solar power tariff drops to record low   Finland-based energy firm Fortum Finnsurya Energy quoting Rs 4.34 to bag the mandate to set up a 70MW solar plant under NTPC's Bhadla Solar Park tender. Officials have said the tariff with investor confidence as well as a positive outlook for NTPC.     Kinetic energy holds a lot of promise, and the Wavestar offers a revolutionary way of harnessing the kinetic  energy  of waves and convert it into   electricity  . Located in the Scandinavian country of  Denmark , Wavestar is a sort of hybridized machine and production facility. It's equipped with kinetic-energy harvesters called 'floats' that resemble the oars used to propel boats. The floats move up and down with the kinetic energy of the waves, and their motion is transferred via hydraulics to rotate power generators.     The technology enables continuous energy production with a smooth output. It's also  safe , as the floats can be lifted to a safe position in the event of a storm. The facility can be even upgraded to utilize wind and  solar power , and the power stations are planned to hit the market next year. The full-scale machine will have 20 floats with a diameter of 10 m each, thus making each power station capable of producing 6 megawatts of energy.             Meet the compact, energy-efficient bio-powered supercomputer prototype   The model bio-supercomputer is much smaller than current supercomputers, uses much less energy, and uses proteins present in all living cells to function.         This means that a single machine could be used to provide energy for close to 4,000  households . Our oceans are a vast source of clean energy. If we could capture just 0.1% of the  oceans'  tidal kinetic energy, it would be enough to satisfy the current global energy demand over five times. Innovative technologies like the Wavestar are the need of the hour, and could one day offer definitive solution to the world's energy problems.
