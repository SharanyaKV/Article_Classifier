There is now yet another way for Britain's hordes of movie fans to access the latest blockbusters and television seasons.

Following on from the success of Netflix, NOW TV, Google Play Movies and Amazon Prime – TalkTalk has launched its own TalkTalk TV.

The overhauled new service is actually a refresh of BlinkBox, which the broadband supplier bought from supermarket giant Tesco last year.

According to TalkTalk, the new movie rental platform has been completely updated and offers more than 7,000 of the latest and greatest movies and TV shows.

Available to buy or rent, these can then be downloaded across a number of devices including mobile, desktop and TV via a selection of apps, or online video players.

TalkTalk is bragging that its TalkTalk TV service has Britain’s lowest prices but we wouldn't get too excited.

Renting an High Definition copy of Star Wars Episode VII The Force Awakens costs £4.49 on iTunes and Google Play Movies.

The same film will set you back £4.45 via TalkTalk –  a saving of 4p. Interestingly, Amazon Prime Instant video charges the same amount for 
Star Wars Episode VII
 and a number of other new releases.

Because TalkTalk is entering an already saturated marketplace, experts are predicting it could struggle.

Commenting on the new service, telecoms expert Cable.co.uk, Dan Howdle said: "It's difficult to see where the TalkTalk TV Store fits exactly in such a crowded market – it appears to be struggling to find a unique selling point.

"Netflix specialises in original high-quality programming while offering a decent range of generally older movies and TV shows. 

"Conversely, Amazon Prime Instant Video does the opposite, specialising in newer movies to rent, buy or stream as part of the service, while dabbling in its own original content.

"Parting those waves is Sky's Now TV, which offers the most up-to-date subscription-inclusive movies and TV of the three, but does not offer one-off rentals or movies 'only just out'.

"When Tesco ran this service as Blinkbox, it struggled because it couldn't find a comfy spot between these heavyweight contenders.

"I'm not seeing anything here beyond the average rental coming in marginally cheaper. That won't be enough."

If you do fancy giving it a go viewers will be able to register up to five devices to their account, and watch one film or programme on their TalkTalk TV while streaming or downloading another on a different device.

Additionally, existing TalkTalk customers can access the new service by simply using their TalkTalk log-in details, meaning no need to create another account or provide credit card details. 

At the end of the month, any purchases will be added directly to their monthly bill.

TalkTalk recently came bottom of the list for customer service.

The broadband supplier scored just 38 per cent in the
