  Within months of retiring from Infosys in 2014, co-founders Kris Gopalakrishnan and SD Shibulal got together again to found a startup accelerator called Axilor. Shibulal talks about the inspiration for the venture and the challenges of Indian entrepreneurship.   You and Kris could have chosen to just be angel investors, but you preferred to start an accelerator programme... India is in the early stage of entrepreneurial development. The number of people who have gone through this journey are few. Kris and I have built scale and know how to do it. We also realized that we need to particularly support the bottom of the pyramid startups, lest the quality of the pipeline gets choked. A diverse set of experiences is required to help these startups grow and improve the odds of success. Most people fail during the first 24 months. That's when mentorship is most required. This is why we thought we should be an institutional angel helping startups through this period.  You have a special focus on education and healthcare...  What Kumari (wife) and I have learnt is that the only way to change one's life is through education. We grew up in small towns. My wife was the first one from her village to go to college. So when we want to transform lives, we believe that (education) is the right way to do so. Many of the children we have supported (through their NGO) have gone on to do good higher education. My father was a doctor. He wanted me to be a doctor. So it has been a subject close to my heart and this is an opportunity to work in the sector.   Axilor is planning some highly targeted innovation initiatives, and you have just started one in diabetes. What's the objective?  There are a lot of healthcare issues in our country including of affordability and access. The number of startups outside of aggregation or discovery in healthcare is minimal. You need scientists, who usually have ideas to start up, but would not because of capital access issues. VCs are not interested in this space. These are long gestation projects and need lots of capital. And you have to train the scientists to think like entrepreneurs. So we think this requires very special attention. If we support a good number of initiatives, a few may emerge as breakthrough innovations. There's a science to bringing an idea out of universities/labs to market and making it big. We decided to start with diabetes because it is reaching epidemic proportions.  What do you see as some of the other challenges in Indian entrepreneurship?    I see three major challenges. One is the need for simplification. Entrepreneurship is all about experimentation and many ideas may fail. So starting a venture and shutting it down must be simple. But in our country, there's still a lot of friction in this space. The second is that for a country of our size, we need diversification. The number of applications to our accelerator have gone up from 80 in the first batch to 170 in the second batch to 240 in the third. But majority of them tend to be in the e-commerce and online consumer internet space. We have enormous requirements in healthcare, education, clean technologies etc. Those are not showing up, and that's the reason for our targeted initiatives. The third is institutionalization which I talked about earlier. On our own, we can support only so many founders. But if we can institutionalize support, it can have a multiplier effect. We like to think of ourselves as a new-age institutional angel.      Compared to the time when you started Infosys or even may be a decade ago, do you find that founders in your programme today are complacent about money?      Our entire model is built on capital being a constraint and capital not being a replacement for customers. We focus a lot on the burn rate and how long cash will last. We help to them to focus, we advise on making right recruitments — one wrong recruitment can turn out to be very expensive.   Do founders come with the attitude of making money through quick exits?   It is not a bad thing. We also want exits. We know a 22-year-old who is doing his third startup now. He failed and lost money in the first, made good money in the second. Think of the experience he brings to the table at his age; in that short period, he gets the wisdom of 20 years in a corporate.
