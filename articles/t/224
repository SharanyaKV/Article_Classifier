  NEW DELHI: Taiwanese PC manufacturer  Acer  Inc has just launched its latest Chromebook 14 for Work, and the company is saying that it's the fastest Chromebook it has ever made.           Acer launches Predator gaming series in India   Acer India has launched its global line of gaming series Predator in India. The launch includes diverse form factors of notebooks, desktops, projectors and gaming monitors.        The  Chromebook  14 for Work is powered by the latest Intel Core i5 Skylake CPU, and comes with up to 8 GB of RAM. It also packs a full HD display, and includes a 720p webcam with a wide angle lens (However, these specifications are for the top-end model, and base models are likely to come with 1366x768 resolution and lesser RAM). You also get a  USB Type-C  port, three USB 3.1 ports, a DisplayPort, as well as an audio jack and an HDMI port with the new Chromebook 14 for Work.             Acer launches Liquid M330 Windows 10 smartphone   Acer has expanded its Liquid series with the launch of Acer Liquid M330. The company has priced the handset at $99.99 and it will be available at the Microsoft Stores and Microsoftstore.com.         The laptop is  Acer's  first Chromebook meeting  Google's  Chrome for Work standard, geared towards enterprise users. Battery life is claimed to be around 12 hours, and there's also a spill-resistant keyboard thrown into the mix. What's most interesting about the Chromebook 14 for Work is that it is MIL-STD 810G certified and thus capable of surviving drops from up to four feet, despite having a  Corning Gorilla Glass  lid.       The  Chromebook  14 for Work will be available in May, with prices starting at around $349. However, not much is known about its availability in India yet.     It's also worth noting that Acer released another Chromebook 14 earlier this year, powered by a more humble Celeron processor.
