  The fight against tuberculosis just got fiercer. The Centre is ready to announce universal drug susceptibility testing (DST) in Mumbai as a pilot project for the rest of the country, said Dr Sunil Khaparde, deputy director general of the Central Tuberculosis Division, on Saturday.       The universal DST is a part of the World Health Organisation's strategy  to 'end TB by 2035'. Currently, a patient is first tested for simple TB that needs six to nine months of treatment. If the patient doesn't respond to this treatment within, say, three months, he is tested further for drug resistance. If the patient is resistant to two of the normal drug regimens, he is said to suffer from multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. If the patient is resistant to more than two drugs as well as an antibiotic injection given to MDR-TB patients, he has extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB. Drug-resistant TB needs over two years of treatment,  with drugs costing more than Rs 2 lakh.          The magnitude of the delayed-treatment problem in Mumbai can be judged from a study done by the Foundation for Medical Research that showed that, on an average, drug-resistant TB patients take 192 days to start treatment from the time symptoms appear. "We estimate that there are roughly 75,000 cases of MDR-TB cases in India. But in 2015, we had only 26,000 on treatment," said Dr Khaparde.        "There is a huge gap that could be addressed by a better detection system such as universal DST." He also cited a study published in Lung India medical journal earlier in the week by Hinduja Hospital's Dr Zarir Udwadia and Dr Camilla Rodrigues that underlined the importance of universal DST.        "Of the 1,539 MDR-TB cases identified by the TB laboratory at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai , only 30% were truly MDR-TB; the remaining cases represented pre-XDR, XDR, and resistance beyond XDR-TB," said an editorial in Lung India. In other words, nearly two-thirds of this sample would have received incorrect dosage of drugs and risked developing higher levels of resistance, the article explained.
