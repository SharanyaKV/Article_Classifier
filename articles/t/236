When the universe was born around 13.5billion years ago, for a period of about 400,000 years the entire cosmos glowed orange

This was because of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

If you point a satellite to a pitch black spot within the universe, you’d expect to see darkness, but what you would actually see is static, which is the CMB.

However, during the early days of the universe, the CMB – which is made up of electrons and protons – would have been orange because it had nothing to travel into.

The heat of the universe was so intense that it didn’t allow neutral atoms to form, and thus meaning that the electrons and protons could not coalesce into atoms.

It meant that the two just collided with each other continuously, creating an orange glow called plasma which was emitting a thermal distribution of electromagnetic waves making it bright and hot.

However, as the universe was expanding, as it always has been, the waves became stretched out meaning that they were cooling and allowing neutrons to form.

The neutrons would coalesce with the electrons to create atoms, allowing things like stars and everything else in the universe to form.

But this was after one last hurrah.

The expanding wavelengths were undergoing a transformation in a process known as cosmological redshift.

This meant that the wavelengths became red as they stretched, causing the universe to get lighter as if an infinite amount of orange lightbulbs were being turned on, before - lights out, causing the universe to go black as we see it today.

Over the ensuing 13bn years, the universe has continued to expand and cool down, allowing us to see the darkness, or static, that now feels the vacant spots where there is no light.
