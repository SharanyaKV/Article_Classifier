In the early Cretaceous period, between 125 and 120 million years ago, researchers discovered that dinosaurs began moving away from Europe.

A team of scientists from the University of Leeds created a computer model of the fossil record of dinosaurs to figure out their migration pattern up until their extinction 65 million years ago.

They found that there was a mass exodus of dinosaurs between 125 and 120m years ago while no new species were moving in.

Lead author of the study published in the Journal of Biogeography, Dr Alex Dunhill, of Leeds University, said: "This is a curious result that has no concrete explanation.

"It might be a real migratory pattern or it may be an artefact of the incomplete and sporadic nature of the dinosaur fossil record.”

At the time, much of the Earth’s land mass was connected as part of a supercontinent known as Pangaea, but it was beginning to separate due to tectonic activity, which was also confirmed by the study.

Dr Dunhill continued: "We presume that temporary land bridges formed due to changes in sea levels, temporarily reconnecting the continents.

"Such massive structures - spanning, for example, from Indo-Madagascar to Australia - may be hard to imagine. 

“But over the timescales that we are talking about, which is in the order of tens of millions of years, it is perfectly feasible that plate tectonic activity gave rise to the right conditions for such land bridges to form."
