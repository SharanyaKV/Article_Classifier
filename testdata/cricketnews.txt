NEW DELHI: Having pulled off a hattrick of convincing and successful run chases, Sunrisers Hyderabad start as favourites against struggling debutants Rising Pune Supergiants who are on a four-match losing streak.

With three successive wins that came after two consecutive losses, Sunrisers have risen from the brink to emerge as a force to reckon with being led by the destructive David Warner who has not only struck form with the bat but has also looked more and more dangerous with his strokeplay getting only more explosive with each outing in the middle.

The Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side started their IPL campaign on a winning note against the defending champions Mumbai Indians but that has been their only victory till now and it will take no less than a miracle for Pune to outwit Hyderabad at their home ground who would look to make things only more difficult for the debutants.
